1928	charli	Margaret Potter	The quality of the fabric is very disappointing. It is stiff & scratchy; I thought it would be fluid & soft.Returning & genuinely disappointed as I have bought quite a few items from Charli.	2025-05-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681a5492ebf4ca62111ac65d	-0.38885714285714285	negative	["quality", "fabric", "disappointing", "stiff", "scratchy", "thought", "would", "fluid", "softreturning", "genuinely"]
1929	charli	Philippa Vince	In response to your reply- my  name is not Tracey- the set was the Stella khaki and I have your email reply - there has been no reply to my last email. This is a fair and honest review about a product I liked but was not fit for purpose after wearing once. I’m not sure saying my review is fake is the right way to deal with this.  Outfit was lovely - was one size and I’m about a 12/14  the trousers in the set were very loose not tightWore once and fabric ripped away from the seam. I was only sitting. So no way could have been over stretched. Sent a lovely email explaining and suggesting was a fault. Email back saying won’t refund or return as nothing wrong when left warehouse. Now not replying to emails- outfit was £90 should have been made better. I pay more for clothes to last. I will now start a repay  through my credit card as not fit for purpose. Would not use again communication is  dreadful and such a shame as the item was really nice otherwise.	2025-04-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6816fac25195a1e29f46b00a	0.08633540372670806	neutral	["email", "reply", "set", "last", "review", "fit", "purpose", "saying", "way", "outfit"]

1932	charli	Karen W	I placed an order on Friday and paid next day delivery via UPS at the highly inflated price of £9.99. Did not realise they don’t deliver on a Saturday/sunday (surely highly unusual these days?!!) would not have placed order had I realised. Item not received till Monday.

1933	charli	T C	I would like to share an experience I had with Charli. Due to a medical situation requiring a hospital stay, I was unable to return items within their 15-day return policy. However, I could have returned them within 28 days, which is standard for many clothing companies and boutiques. I escalated the issue to the founder, seeking a compassionate response and flexibility for an exchange instead of a refund. Regrettably, I was treated in an unsympathetic manner, which was unexpected from a boutique I believed valued empathy. While I understand the company may cite its returns policy, I was seeking kindness. I am now left with £600 worth of items I cannot use and will not buy from this company again—a shame, as a well known celebrity had endorsed this company, which I have since informed them about.	2025-01-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67e0431e2a285544519867f2	0.034375	neutral	["company", "return", "items", "within", "policy", "seeking", "would", "like", "share", "experience"]

1936	charli	Verity B	Sizing is crazy! I bought a one-size cardigan and as a UK Size 10 (8-10 in some brands) I wrongly expected that it would fit but it was so small and clung in all the wrong places. It looked lovely in the bag but sadly not on me.	2025-02-07	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a5f24757543c0a6a716496	-0.06428571428571428	neutral	["sizing", "crazy", "bought", "onesize", "cardigan", "size", "810", "brands", "wrongly", "expected"]
1937	charli	Eva Bochenek	I bought a jumper that cost approx £70 in one size and it is humungous but also, the quality is extremely poor. I have emailed for a resolution (refund or discount as I have worn it) over the last few months with no response or acknowledgement from customer service. The jumper is so bobbly and just looks like a cheap jumper from primark after one wash. Not worth the cost at all	2024-12-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a5eeac046b1dc775af47a6	-0.07000000000000002	neutral	["jumper", "cost", "one", "bought", "approx", "\\u00a370", "size", "humungous", "also", "quality"]

I was gifted a jumper for Christmas and the zip is faulty. I have kept all the labels on the jumper and Charli are refusing to refund me- so I therefore suggested an exchange, still refused. I have never experienced such poor customer satisfaction levels!

1939	charli	sadie robertshaw	I ordered the Kera dress in darkest espresso and the Iris satin dress in espresso. This was my first order with Charli. My order was dispatched quickly, it was well packaged and both the items are absolutely beautiful and fit well. I can’t wait to wear this outfit and I probably will order both in another colour soon. My only regret is that I was offered 10% off my first order; I thought I had both items in the basket but when I checked out I realised I had only ordered the Kiera dress so immediately ordered the Iris dress. My fault but missed out on the 10% and paid two lots of delivery charges even though it arrived in the same package.	2025-01-17	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/678f434c59868b91233621b8	0.26041666666666663	neutral	["dress", "order", "ordered", "espresso", "iris", "first", "well", "items", "kera", "darkest"]

I tried to send it back giving the reason why but the website would only accept my return if I changed my reason.

1954	charli	Paula Bamfield	Be sure you want to keep your item(s) before you order!  Not only are you charged for the original delivery, but you are also charged for the return AND the original delivery charge you paid is deducted AGAIN from your refund too.  So you pay for delivery TWICE if you dare to return, as well as the return charge.  Rang customer service (as I assumed it to be a mistake), only to be glibly directed to small print in their T&Cs saying they always deduct the delivery charge you paid too as they 'gave that money to Royal Mail' (their choice of supplier for their business).  I was also emphatically informed by Sam that the reason my top was 'so cheap' is because customers who keep items shouldn't be penalised by people like me returning them!  Have bought from Charli several times in the past but never had to return before. One top costing £36 cost me £11.89 to have delivered and to return.  Beware!  Interestingly, I returned the top because it was dreadful quality with stitching at the collar coming apart.  Charli is most definitely not what it used to be.  I will not be buying again.

1958	charli	Mrs. Julie Thompson	*Update* Despite the first purchase not being a great experience, I placed a second order for a different blouse. This time the material was spot on, and the toile pattern was just lovely. I'm really happy to have given Charli a second chance and got a beautiful blouse to wear. I ordered the Mae blouse and the description stated that ' Mae is a soft viscose blouse with a relaxed fit'. When the blouse arrived, it was clearly made from very thin cotton, and not viscose at all. It was very creased when I got it out of the packet, and this type of cotton will never look good like the picture on the website. If I had known the item was cotton, rather than viscose I wouldn't have ordered it. I checked how to return the blouse and saw that, although items have free delivery,  £3.99 is deducted for P&P for returns. I tried to contact customer service on the phone, as I'm not happy that the full amount wouldn't be returned, especially as I would have kept the item if it was made from the fabric as described. There was no answer on the phone and the mailboxes were all full for the various extensions. I am awaiting a reply by email. Even though Charli gives you the option to review items, there are no visible reviews for any of the items. This is concerning as it's hard to get ideas of customer satisfaction of the website.*Edit- I had a reply by email the next working day, and they have agreed to refund the charges and will also change the description for the blouse. It's a pity they won't actually change the material for the blouse as it would be a really lovely item in a better fabric.	2024-02-24	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65e364c58a8c02337711d164	0.21108974358974358	neutral	["blouse", "viscose", "cotton", "item", "items", "second", "material", "lovely", "really", "happy"]
1959	charli	Ottilie Swift	About a year ago I went to purchase something from Charli. I bought a skirt took it home and tried it on. It didn’t look quite right on me once I brought it home and so took it back to the store a couple of days later in the original packaging and pristine condition. They refused to offer me a refund and instead gave me store credit (£80). I said that I wasn’t 100% sure on the skirt when I bought it and that the assistant helping me knew that and therefore should have told me that they didn’t offer returns. Anyway, I was upset as £80 is a lot of money for me. I checked on their website and it did say they offer returns. So I went back to the shop the next day and they were actually pretty unpleasant towards me even though I am pretty shy and extremely un-confrontational. Since then I haven’t been back to use my store credit because it is such an unfriendly environment (I was also told I couldn’t use store credit in any other branch of the shop or online). Is it just me or does this feel like stealing? Anyway we are are a year on now and it still upsets me when I think about it.	2023-04-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65e08ddf899dce26f414ca91	0.01738095238095238	neutral	["store", "back", "offer", "credit", "year", "went", "bought", "skirt", "took", "home"]

The items I currently have are the Maddie shirt in navy, Maya shirt in jeans blue, ligia shirt in French toile, poppy sweater in ivory, a lilac wrap over(OOS) and a cream poncho all absolutely gorgeous, perfect fit and incredible quality. The poppy sweater comes up large around the neckline as an FYI, but still recommend it.

Had to fix it myself due to stock issues. I have worn it a lot but quality not great. Have just bought a shirt in the same print and the material is thin, it will be good for holidays but again not great quality for the price. Finally I have one of their £45 long cardigans. Much looser knit than I was expecting but I liked the length of it. Sadly I have now found it elsewhere at a fraction of the cost. Charli have an interesting selection of clothes but on the whole I find them overpriced for the quality.	2023-10-07	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65435abf2c203db2ac388c35	0.048333333333333325	neutral	["print", "quality", "really", "find", "bought", "great", "like", "inspired", "company", "anywhere"]

I emailed to ask how to return an item which is faulty as they cover the cost. I call and speak to Sabeena - immediately I feel at ease - very apologetic, asks me to mark the item for her attention and reassures me they will pay the cost to return it. First refund confirmation is for the item cost only - excluding original postage and the additional postage I paid to return. I follow up and they return the original postage only. I follow up again.  They then say they can’t refund the money I paid because they use Shopify and I can have a discount instead. I explain that I don’t want a discount and would like to stick to the original terms of our contract. Because they are breaching those terms, they then said the garment didn’t smell, therefore wasn’t faulty and everything was a gesture of goodwill because they don’t believe there’s a problem. I would avoid ordering here… if you have a problem, you will have a tough time resolving it. I’ve never received clothes which smell before… an all round unpleasant experience. Order #32113In response to their reply:- they won’t reply to my emails or call me- they offered me a discount to buy more clothes instead of honouring their own T&Cs! Who would buy more clothes from a company who send smelly clothes and have terrible customer services?- they won’t refund the cost I incurred on postage despite telling me they would (hence I posted it)So when they say they’ve explained their returns procedure, they’ve explained they can’t honour their returns terms and asked if I would like to buy more clothes.

2015	charlielondon	Emily	Wrong size sentI ordered a dress from Charlyn London and received the wrong size due to their error. Instead of offering a full refund with return shipping covered, which is my legal right under UK consumer protection, they tried to persuade me with partial refunds or gift cards. I requested a full refund, but they refused to reimburse the return postage, even though the mistake was theirs.This lack of accountability and refusal to honour my rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 is unacceptable. I am now in the process of escalating this through Trading Standards and Citizens Advice.Be cautious when purchasing from Charlyn London, if they make an error, you could be stuck with unwanted items or forced to pay to return their mistake.	2025-06-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/685a68e005fd1427161f98ce	-0.0376984126984127	neutral	["return", "wrong", "size", "charlyn", "london", "error", "full", "refund", "consumer", "mistake"]

Ordered a pair of linen pants and after two months was emailing back-and-forth and they would give me a specific date and guarantee it would be shipped by then and it never would. Anytime I would address it they would just say sorry working on it and do nothing. Mind you they would never say that they’re sold out of these pants or on backorder. I ended up messaging the owner on insta and he told me they’d be sending me a $100 gift card and big shocker I never got it.

2079	myoutfitonline	Sydney Smith	I am absolutely in love with this brand, this is not for PR or marketing as this is solely my honest review. This brand popped up as an Ad on my Instagram time line. They advertised as being super soft, stretchy “go to” basics. I never order clothes online and especially not off an Instagram ad. I’ve very picky about quality and material, because who likes scratchy material right. I took a leap of faith because honestly the small color selections and styles were a nice change from normal big brands with thousands of pieces to choose from. So far I’ve purchased two long sleeves, a short sleeve and a pair of their pro technical pants. I can honestly say their material is sooo soft and stretchy and will be a staple in my closet. Shipping time to California from Florida is a little long but tracking is good and their customer support dosent miss a beat, you can even contact them via Instagram. They really listen to their clients wants as far as new products and are very interactive on ig lives and in their comment sections. Prices are a little up there but it shows in the quality. Also for anyone who does purchase, to maintain the quality, hand wash your pieces, allow to hang dry over night/ a day and then tumble dry on ultra delicate for 5 minutes, they’ll feel brand new	2023-03-14	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64304c15aeec91ae177512f2	0.15107875994972778	neutral	["brand", "instagram", "quality", "material", "time", "soft", "stretchy", "honestly", "pieces", "far"]

When I received the clothing, I'm not kidding you when I say it could have fit my 9lb dogs.Unfortunately, this company handled it very poorly. They said they didn’t accept returns but they would make an “exception” for me and give me a store credit minus the shipping if I sent it back. I did, then got an email saying they were “rejecting” 2 of the 4 items I returned since it appeared there was hair on it and the “hygienic liners had been removed then placed back on”. I did no such thing considering I couldn’t even get this stuff over my head or hips. I am beyond disappointed and I will be filing a dispute with my bank.

2084	myoutfitonline	Nguyễn Bá Phương Ngân	I'm normally size US2-4. Ordered some size S from their website and all the items were so tight, like I might have to wear size US6 or M for their brand. The fabric, the sewing,... the overall quality is honestly not worth the price. You might be able to find similar quality for a way cheaper price elsewhere. The worst part is they don't even do refunds, only store credits, which sucks because I don't think I wanna order anything else from them after this patch.UPDATE:My order was placed during the Black Friday - Cyber Monday sale, and there was no clear announcement on the website that sales during this period are final sales. It was only apparent on their return portal so I emailed them about the issue with the stuff I ordered and I'd like an exchange or refund. Finally, after going back and forth a few rounds they agreed to let me send the stuff back and they would "inspect" them before going on with my requested process.It's been 3 weeks now since the return made it back to their facility (according to my tracking number), I emailed them twice asking about the process and still got no reply. Up to this point, I think both their cloth quality and customer service deserve 0 star! I'll keep you guys updated about whether or not I get my money back from this website!UPDATE: I emailed them again directly to the contact email on the website (not in the same email chain earlier). A week went by, nothing, no reply to any of the emails asking about the refund, so I decided to dispute the transaction on my credit card. And voila! A day after the dispute was notified by the bank, they replied to my email and "happy to refund you if you drop the dispute". Too late now. I'll let the bank take care of it.Be aware of these snakes, guys!

2087	myoutfitonline	Miss Natalie Milnes	Placed my order on the 20th November. It is now 11th December and my items are no where to be seen, which btw were not cheap and the shipping alone cost me $10.00! The order was around $100.00 in all. When i checked out i got a notification that said it would arrive between the 24th-27th November. That didn't happen.I have messaged them on Instagram numerous times regarding this, (they sometimes open the message and dont reply so i have to message them again) their last reply was that it should take 10 business days to arrive however they didn't dispatch the item until 5 days after purchase so no way was the shipping going to get to me within 10 days. They also said they dispatched the order on the 23rd Nov when it was actually still being "prepared by sender" on the 25th November, which i didn't know at the time as i only received the tracking number on 30th Nov by Royal Mail however you can see items full journey so you can go back and check. I have also tried to do the online chat on their website and no one answered me (even though it said an agent was online).  I understand with the current situation there is bound to be a delay which is why i didn't do anything when it didn't arrive by the 27th Nov. However $10.00 shipping to be waiting 21 days and counting for delivery is ridiculous. I have also been notified that i will have to pay an import fee when it reaches the UK which i wasn't thrilled about or made aware of on the website. But the package is STILL in its country or origin 21 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE! Another thing is I didn't receive a valid tracking number until Royal Mail contacted me regarding the import fee (10 days after purchase) the app they advise you use was useless. Which was worrying due to the amount i spent on this order. So for over a week i had no idea what was going on with my order or where it was.I have asked for a full refund, not just because i haven't received my order, but because I just feel like they were very helpful and quick to reply to comments and messages before the midnight rose drop and i spent my money. Then as soon as i started complaining the customer service just went down hill. and it seems im not the only one who thinks so too regarding their Instagram comments. I have ordered other stuff from abroad during this pandemic and haven't had this issue. I will not be ordering with your company again.

I asked to return this and change for the blue version was is BEAUTIFUL but didn’t work out with my awkward body shape. So, I asked to exchange again for the black version of the same dress which I will be saving to get back into postpartum. As you can imagine I was not an easy customer as I asked for few exchanges and I was finding hard to make up my mind. However, the team was incredibly kind and generous with their time and were extremely helpful and guided me through the process patiently. The communication was amazing.

2397	khanums	SA	Don't buy, don't. Ordered on 2 April, when I reached out, they told me the dress would arrive on 7th May (5 weeks after the order).  The dress came on 23rd May! Two months later! I asked to cancel as one of the wedding events had passed at that point. Got told 'Cancellations are possible only up to 6 hours after the order'.I am trying to exchange the dress as the size does not match conventional sizing. You can exchange once, which I have never heard of. For a company that markets itself as modest, there is nothing modest about the cut. Every time I send an email to customer service, only half of my questions are answered, that is, if they are answered at all. Most of the time, you will get an email that sends half a sentence to kick the can down the road. The quality of the dress feels like a thick polyester tarp from Screwfix. At no point during the ordering process was it made clear that the dress would take 2 months to arrive, that there are no cancellations, or that there are no returns facilitated. My advice: Just don't order. There are better alternatives.	2025-06-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/686039c65fd68237a4ce64d4	0.02630385487528345	neutral	["dress", "dont", "told", "would", "arrive", "may", "order", "months", "point", "cancellations"]

2426	khanums	Nasima	Be warned, this company does not provide refunds and make it overly long winded to get exchange and store credit which last a year. I wanted to buy one dress for bridal party but unfortunately the style and fit looked really off and odd looking in comparison to the pictures on website. All other designs in the store are not for my taste and to be honestly the quality is not worth the price! Customer service was not helpful and simply said it our policy and disregards personal circumstances. The website there is not section for refunds only exchange! I cannot see why refunds are not provided given garment is not worn or customised... Alot of BS about being slow paced fashion but in reality I got the dress within day.

It's great quality and very affordable for the design and the materials. Kate was the one who helped me, she was very nice and kind and i appreciate the fact that she gave me time to decide and see how i feel wearing it. She responded fast to my emails and gave me her professional opinion when i asked for it.

I had to send several emails and beg for the correct dress to be sent, and even then they take several days just to get back to you. They don’t have any phone number to call so you just need to wait patiently for them to respond to your email. The correct dress then came with a broken zipper.

2429	khanums	Maxine Rodrigues	I ordered from this store on the 15th march. The total amount got deducted from my account but the order confirmation was never sent. I gave it some time to come through and it never came so I contacted the team on the 17th march and they told me they dont have any record of my order despite the money being taken from my account. On 17th march I gave Carly all my details including full name, delivery address and informed her that my email was the same as im using. She then told me that she still couldnt locate my order with the email and name i gave her and asked if i was sure that the money had been taken. I sent screenshots of the transaction from my account. I waited 2 days for a response and then decided to make a reorder as I assumed my order was not in the system at all from what she had told me. I sent another email informing them that I had made this re-order and I would be grateful if they could prioritise it given the circumstances with the original order. In addition to further help me with the first order that never went through and was wrongfully deducted from my account.She then became very defensive by saying that they never wrongfully deducted money, and that i did this myself etc etc and then asked me again what name and delivery address is my order under so she could locate it. I gave it to her again for the second time. She again become VERY rude and told me that she found the order and said "I would have managed to locate this eventually using further information provided by yourself". ( i had already given her the info 2 days prior). She told me that I did not add my email address to the order and thats why I didnt get the confirmation email. I then told her that actually I had given all information required 2 days ago already so why did she not use it then and instead, tell me she cannot locate my order?She told me that all of this is my fault because I didnt add my email to the order but in reality, I reached out to her for customer service support to figure out the problem and asked for her help (which is her JOB!!!!) She did not even try to give me some peace of mind about the situation and all she did instead was cause me so much stress.	2025-03-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67da96cb92e28a71ed0ba2eb	0.10607142857142858	neutral	["order", "told", "email", "never", "gave", "locate", "march", "deducted", "account", "sent"]

2448	khanums	AMINA	SCAMMERS they take your money to pump their business and to keep it afloat. They pretend that it is slow fashion so they don't need to give you a date. Literally no update of your order. Their business is struggling so they take as many order as they can they can't fulfil and call it slow fashion. Either you don't receive your order or in 3 to 4 months. The CUSTOMER SERVICE are LIAR so you don't write bad review. In 3 occasions they pretended to have sent my order but it was a lie, they sent me wrong DHL links or told me it was on the way. The outfit was for my 40th and my baby celebration.  I literally ordered 10 weeks in advance. When I told MELANIE that I needed the outfit urgently and needed honestly so I could buy a new outfit in case it wouldn't make it she lied repeatedly sending me a wrong link, then she assured me s it was shipped then after that ooops it is a mistake it is shipped now  for sure don't worry. I gave them so many chances to make it right accross weeks.  She even did take an updated address saying my shipment was being sent the day after. RESULT SHE RUINED MY EVENT BY LIYING MULTIPLE TIME! I wish she just told me they had an issue and I couldn't get my dress. I would have found another one. I am joining other unhappy client to report this business for UNFAIR PRACTICE AND ADVANCE FEE FRAUD. I am furious! Don't hesitate to reach out to me I will add you to the list. MELANIE you lied to me repeatedly while I was kind to you.

2450	khanums	Katherine Adams	If I could get away with a 0 star review I would…I purchased a dress and paid £175. My order arrived and the quality of the product was shocking for the price…it didn’t reflect anything of the online images so I chose to return for a refund. I had to pay another £15 to ensure the item was returned and insured as they state in their t&c’s….yet you won’t be issued a refund for any part of delivery. I have then found out after waiting another 5 days for a reply that they don’t ‘refund’ but offer a year only store credit…there is nothing on the website that interests me nor would I want to purchase again with the lack of quality on the outfit. I had to log a complaint with shop pay to then get a reply email for my ‘store credit’…another 7 days have passed and yet again I am being ignored. Absolutely disgusting service from a retailer that legally cannot without a refund in the UK. Your products are cheaply made and charged at a high value. I have had to log a complaint with my bank as I am not willing to let £160 go when I am willing to let the £15 delivery charge and also another £15 go for returning. I have once again sent another email and no doubt will hear nothing as they avoid as I am finding out from real experiences shared online. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Any decent company would issue a refund and thank you for your services but not this one. I will be taking it further with the ombudsman as they clearly will not make contact to myself to be a decent company.

It is now the 5th December and the large size dress has still not been shipped. ( no tracking details provided) they have ignored requests for a refund, as the dress will not arrive in time for her formal.  The dress cost us over $500 including having to pay for return shipping & tracking.  We are angry and would warn anyone looking to purchase, especially if there is no number to actually speak to anybody.

2467	khanums	Joel Otten	In June, I placed an order with Khanum’s. It took them 3 months to deliver the package! Every time I emailed them to ask where my package was, I kept getting the same response: that it was about to be shipped. Only when I threatened to take legal action did they finally send my package. In the end, I returned the package at my own expense.They also tried to scam me by sending a PayPal link for supposed customs fees, claiming the package could only be received if those fees were paid. I called DHL, and none of this was true—the package had already been received by Khanum’s three weeks earlier. When I confronted them with this, they immediately refunded my money and dropped the customs fee issue.Biggest scammers ever, even though you wouldn’t guess it from their social media channels.

2468	khanums	Consumer	DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! I recently ordered two evening gowns for an upcoming event coming to a total of £500. It was always my intention to return one and just wanted a colour option. They state that the dresses are made to order but they are dispatched the next day. So that’s a lie. The dresses arrived and sadly did not fit me despite me going by the measurement guide.I then tried to return for a refund and to my shock, they only do store credit or exchange. If you are anything like me and probably the majority of online shoppers, no one goes and checks a return policy before ordering, its a given in this day and age that you can return, esp when the dresses have security tags. The company does not warn you at any point before placing the order that you can only exchange. It’s a total joke! I now have two dresses costing £500 that do not fit me and despite me raising this with them directly they have done nothing to help me or show any understanding.I will never buy from them again or recommended to anyone.The dresses are not what they look like on the website either don’t be fooled.	2024-11-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6729f9829472a6c1dafde5ac	-0.07999999999999999	neutral	["dresses", "return", "buy", "company", "two", "total", "\\u00a3500", "one", "order", "day"]

I placed an order on the 5th of May 2024 and have been dealing with an unending series of delays ever since. After returning the item, I was told on the 19th of August it would be sent back to me. When it didn’t arrive, I followed up on the 28th of August and was assured once again that it would be sent. But by the 26th of September, I still hadn’t received the dress.After months of delays, I finally requested a refund and was promised it would be processed within 30 working days. Now, it has been over a month since this promise, and I still haven’t received anything.I have been more than patient throughout this process, but enough is enough. I expect a full refund immediately, with no further delays or excuses. If this issue is not resolved, I will be left with no choice but to consider legal action.This experience has been incredibly disappointing, and I hope others are aware of the risks before purchasing.	2024-05-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/671f246571a755c4c4fbd409	-0.07692307692307693	neutral	["experience", "delays", "would", "since", "august", "sent", "still", "received", "refund", "enough"]

2478	khanums	Sharna	There needs to be a serious review of what exactly you define as slow fashion. Slow fashion only applies when it’s time to give people their money back. You ship dresses in 2 days, stop claiming they are made to order.You state you want to encourage shoppers to shop responsibly so they should not over order, but why would anyone over order when on average your dresses are between £200-300. When we are spending this much with you we are obviously making an informed decision on parting with our money. If you really cared about the environment you would not give credit notes instead of a refunds as this encourages people to shop for things they do not need which is a complete contradiction of your so called “ethos”Seriously review your integrity as a business, because it is a joke.	2024-08-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6700148b08e2483a295a1f02	-0.03589743589743589	neutral	["review", "slow", "fashion", "give", "people", "money", "dresses", "shop", "order", "would"]

I emailed asking about a dress FOR MY WEDDING WELCOME PARTY getting to me in time by 8/20 (I sent this email in July), and while they couldn’t “garuntee it” they basically said it would be fine. Fast forward, I’ve been emailing weekly to get an update. Up until last week (the week before 8/20) the emails I was getting said “any time now” and “soon”. I emailed them on Monday 8/19 asking for an update and got no response. I emailed again on Tuesday 8/20 and got no response. On Wednesday I emailed a different email address they have and once again got no response. I paid almost $500 for a dress to not get a single response about it.

The dresses are of very poor quality with dubious cuts that they try to sell as made-to-measure. To top it all off, they don't accept returns and will come up with any excuse to avoid refunding you. NEVER EVER EVER buy on this site, you'll save your money, your time and your energy. Because even if you have a good reason to return an item that has cost you a lot of money, they don't respect consumers.	2024-07-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66acb31c23fbc39f81c45b0b	-0.07400000000000002	neutral	["ever", "lot", "dont", "money", "worst", "experience", "merchant", "ive", "life", "consume"]
2490	khanums	lydia Clarke	I was desperate for an orange dress for my friends wedding which had sold out, but they were so responsive on instagram and had some available in the sample sale. I attended and the whole team was incredible, so lovely and attentive and boosting my confidence! The whole experience was incredible, the studio was so easy to get to, they kindly provided drinks especially for my relatives whom were with me, and making them feel so welcomed. The pieces were all amazing, I wish I could’ve bought them all! The materials, the fit and the details were just incredible. They are such unique pieces, timeless and simple but elevated with the fit and design details.

2496	khanums	SG	Horrible experience with this company. They took months to deliver my order, much longer than the expected delivery date. My order that was delivered was incorrect and they are refusing to offer me a refund for the products that I returned unworn and in perfect condition. I am having to escalate this to Citizens Advice as I spent nearly £700 for products I didn’t receive. Wouldn’t recommend. Avoid at all costs! They say they don’t offer refunds but their website clearly states that it is to their discretion (clause 5.3 below) so they are just refusing mine for no reason! I am left with no dresses and nearly £700 spent. This was meant to be for my wedding and has caused a lot of distress. 5.3. Where refunds are eligible as confirmed by the customer care team, it will be processed within 14 business days of receiving the returned item. Please note, we must receive the goods back in order to inspect and conclude refund eligibility. Once this is confirmed, all payments will be returned to the original method of payment	2024-06-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66706c8db474a66c662ca2ad	0.10178571428571428	neutral	["order", "returned", "refusing", "offer", "refund", "products", "spent", "nearly", "\\u00a3700", "receive"]
2514	khanums	Ilkem	I recently wore the Kara dress in White for my engagement shoot in the Amalfi Coast and felt like a million dollars wearing it. The luxurious fabric and impeccable design made made feel like a true queen. The attention to detail and the way it hugged my figure perfectly truly made me stand out. From the elegant silhouette to the intricate embellishments, every aspect of this dress exuded luxury. I received countless compliments and I couldn’t have felt more confident and beautiful. This dress is a true gem in my wardrobe and I can’t wait for another special occasion. I would definitely recommend this brand to my friends and I will definitely be purchasing again.	2024-05-17	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66473d817bfb3f7074990921	0.3683673469387755	positive	["dress", "made", "felt", "like", "true", "definitely", "recently", "wore", "kara", "white"]

2497	khanums	JS	I felt compelled to write this review about my disappointing experience with Khanums, the online clothing shop. One important aspect I would like to highlight, which was not made clear during the ordering process, is their strict no-refund policy. This lack of transparency was quite frustrating and I believe other customers should be aware of this before making a purchase. It may show in the terms and conditions but as it's so unusual, there should be several warnings during the order process.In today's age of online shopping, it is considered standard practice for customers to have the option of trying on clothes they purchase and being offered the opportunity to return them for a refund if they are not satisfied. Unfortunately, Khanums does not provide this flexibility to their customers. This lack of customer-centric approach is highly unusual and can be a major inconvenience for those who prefer to try on clothes before committing to a purchase.Moreover, the quality and proportions of the clothing I received from Khanums were far from satisfactory, especially considering the prices charged. They offered for me to take the dresses to the taylors to get them adjusted, and they would cover that cost. I tend to only buy pieces which fit well right from purchase, especially at this price. It is disheartening to see a company that lacks the willingness to accommodate customers' needs and preferences. The absence of generosity and understanding in their policies is concerning and reflects poorly on the brand.As someone who seldom writes reviews, I felt compelled to share my experience with Khanums to warn other potential customers. The frustrations I encountered throughout the process were incredibly discouraging. I hope this review serves as a cautionary message and helps others make an informed decision when considering shopping here.	2024-06-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/666702a23fceada3da3b43ed	0.020238095238095232	neutral	["customers", "khanums", "purchase", "felt", "compelled", "review", "experience", "online", "clothing", "would"]

I had to message her again because I was nervous the dress won’t arrive on time, I gave her my in-laws address and they actually shipped it and it arrived on time at the correct address. The Korro dress is so beautiful. The material is soft, thick and not see through.It hugs you in the right places.

2517	khanums	Katia Badr	SCAM!They don’t do refunds and they fail to clearly alert you. It’s implied vaguely somewhere in the FAQ that they expect everyone to read and analyse before an order is placed. They have a lead time of up to 40 business days and they fail to clearly alert you. Some items are out of stock, wait a minute, didn’t you claim to produce your items them when we place the order? Then technically there is no such thing as out of stock. So misleading! They don’t do more than one exchange and they fail to clearly state that. So now i am stuck with a dress that doesn’t fit me. Oh chances are they won’t fit you. Designs are so awkward. Oh and by the way they don’t fail to tell you they have luxury packaging and that they give back, but for important information such as lead time and refunds they rely on you going through the FAQ to figure that out. Oh and speaking of luxury packaging, their packaging is so basic. All these strict rules and they don’t have a place to see their products or a number to call.They have caused me a lot of stress.They claim to be a slow fashion company but they are just a scam fashion.

When I finally got the dress, it came faulty and not as advertised on the website which was very clear. I sent the dress back to Khanum's and they said they could make another one very quickly as I had an important event coming up that this was for. I was keen to get this dress back as I really loved it online. They kept pushing back their send date, and then finally, when I absolutely needed it for this event (and after telling me earlier THAT SAME DAY they would send it), they said they couldn't send it because of "unforeseen circumstances". To be kept waiting until the last second is just absolutely terrible service. I said from the get-go that I was happy with a refund when the dress was faulty the first time around.

2533	khanums	AW	Firstly, they shipped the incorrect item and then experienced delays in sending the correct one. Despite my attempts to address the situation by contacting customer service, I was met with automated responses that seemed disconnected from my specific concerns.Faced with the prospect of not receiving the correct item in time for my event due to the delays, I reached out again, expressing my urgency and requesting a cancellation or refund. However, instead of addressing my request directly, they simply reiterated their intention to ship my correct order as soon as possible, even though I had just explained that this would be useless given the time constraints. Additionally, I was directed to their returns page, which suggested that any return shipping costs would be at my own expense, with only a credit note offered in return.As someone who values supporting small businesses, artists, and designers, I was deeply disappointed by this experience.

I was worried the size down would be too small. And as I got them with a discount code I can’t return them which is in there T&C (just didn’t read that till I went to look at returning). I would have loved if there was an option to return for a voucher or if they had some sort of marketplace for Khanums customers to sell to eachother because I now I have this incredible dress in my wardrobe that I can’t wear and don’t know what to do with. I think and maybe in the future this might happen if we could come to the show room to try on things to know our exact sizing. The thing that caught be out with one of the items was the invisible zipper. Closed when it was off but because of the curves in my body I couldn’t pull it up and those zippers are hard to grip. All in all quality and everything is amazing but you really need to be so certain on your sizing especially if you’re buying with a discount code. If it’s full price you’re fine ❤️❤️	2024-03-06	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65fb333a5a65fb95dad911a4	0.19215167548500883	neutral	["khanums", "really", "big", "look", "items", "would", "discount", "code", "return", "know"]

2551	khanums	Sadia Khanom	I don’t usually do reviews but, this is definitely a well deserving review. Khanums has always been close to my heart, with such a heartwarming backstory of the owner - her struggles, tenacity and following her heart was very inspirational and brave. After coming across Khanums many years ago, I decided to buy her first few designs. I had purchased two embellished blazers and all I can say is WOW. I was beyond stunned, as I am usually weary of boutique brands - sometimes quality can be compromised. The quality from the lining, the exterior, the hand crafted embellishments to the sizing was beyond imaginable. Every blazer is so well thought and designed meticulously to ensure you look ££££ and COMFORTABLE at the same time. The blazers were heavy, long lasting and pictures definitely do not do justice. Alongside product quality, the service was impeccable. There were clear communication of purchase, easy transaction and clear delivery of the product. I am so proud of the owner, she takes pride in her work and GIVES 10000% to all her customers. A few years fast forward, after the brand has been very successful - I decided to message Rokeya on Instagram, with shock I received an instant reply. She was so helpful with my enquiries and the customer service is beyond explainable. Please do not hesitate to buy from Khanums, I have had bad experiences with boutique companies - Khanums definitely deserve the merit and I wish you all the success! I have now ordered for my wedding and my mother will also be wearing a Khanums outfit for my big day.

The company doesn’t just feel like a brand but more a community 🫶🏽 I plan to make more purchases with them in the future and would recommend to anyone else	2023-12-31	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65aa6c35d7d7d88f8c5f17e0	0.34750000000000003	positive	["brand", "fashion", "clothing", "items", "highest", "quality", "incredibly", "flattering", "definitely", "worth"]
2577	khanums	Reeya	I bought the OG bomber jacket years ago from Khanums during the early days, when there was a pop up event. From the moment I walked in the owner, Rokeya was so friendly, understanding of what I wanted and honest with what suited me. Anyone can buy from any shop or business but what makes it a better experience and wanting you to return is the service you receive. The quality of this jacket is outstanding, it’s still in perfect condition after many wears and is forever going to be trendy. I will definitely be buying more from Khanums, all their clothing looks amazing, I’m just waiting to reach my goal size then I’m buying everything!!! I also bought those cute face masks back when covid started and they were trendy!  lovely customer service 5* and the owner is so friendly and welcoming, so thank you once again xx	2023-01-28	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65aa6a587210251c39d55ae0	0.4875	positive	["bought", "jacket", "khanums", "owner", "friendly", "service", "trendy", "buying", "bomber", "years"]

2612	khanums	Louise	I was initially so drawn to Khanum's - I wanted to support a female-owned, slow fashion brand for my wedding dress this summer. I ordered based on my exact measurements, and received a dress I couldn't even get on. The horrors began when I tried to return the dress. They do advertise a no-refund, store-credit only process. They stated I needed the following (verbatim from email): - Send using a tracked service and provide us with the tracking number and courier details. (DONE)Please note, it is important that you mark this as a return and no commercial value (£0/£1) as we will not be liable for any import duties/taxes. (IN HINDSIGHT, A HUGE RED FLAG!)- No damages, alterations, stains or marks. (DONE)- Security ribbon intact and not tampered with (DONE)- Please send an image of the garment with the ribbon intact before returning it. (DONE)I paid the $80 to return the dress with express, international, tracked shipping. A month later, the dress had been delivered, but they claimed it never arrived. They claim it is my fault for not using DHL shipping. To reiterate the package WAS DELIVERED by USPS, but was most likely stolen or misplaced once reaching Khanum's. They refuse to send another garment or refund me, and there is nothing else I can do to prove its delivery or loss on the USPS-side. Now I'm out hundreds of dollars and a wedding dress. Fraudulent scam of a company, with incredibly condescending employees (which you can see with their responses to negative reviews!).	2023-06-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6482010b8d335bc06b88617b	0.08676470588235295	neutral	["dress", "return", "send", "khanums", "wedding", "using", "tracked", "done", "ribbon", "intact"]
2613	khanums	JEB	Fraudulent.. I would not recommend this company to anybody. I ordered an item and asked to cancel my order as soon as I found out the item would not be delivered on time for an event and was told they could not cancel my order, even when my order was not submitted for production due to delays on their side. I raised a dispute with Paypal and since raising this dispute Khanum some how found a way to prioritise my order but asked me to cancel my dispute with Paypal. I expressed no longer wanting to proceed with my order and to move forward with my refund and I was told by Khanum that my dispute with Paypal will not go in my favour. Luckily Paypal could see Khanum faults and cancelled the order in my favour. Overall, terrible service, no clear overview of return policy or production timings when placing an order. I would recommend Khanum make their return policy clear and make this the main message on their website or at least add this setup as part of the payment process but also make their production timelines a key note for users who are interested in purchasing. With such a poor experience, I would suggest using other websites that are more reliable and not money hungry.	2023-06-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6481ac0e620969f7d7a7c86d	-0.04642857142857145	neutral	["order", "would", "dispute", "paypal", "khanum", "cancel", "production", "make", "recommend", "item"]

2620	khanums	Zana M	I tried my first Khanums piece in 2020, an all-black hand-embellished tailored blazer that kept its form and never lost a single part of its embellishment even after many wears; anywhere I went I’d receive massive amounts of compliments and questions about the brand! My love affair continued and since then I’ve invested in the REVOLVE pearl embellished jumpsuits (flawless!); hugs you in all the right places and suits both my 5.4 hourglass frame and my model friends that are a slim 5.10 or my ladies with the super curves! - It just adjust to your body like all Khanums pieces do!I’ve loved the two-piece silk blazer and skirt combos for any formal celebrations, the long dresses for lifetime celebrations (elegant and super sexy!) - and the short dresses for sexy summer- and winter occasions! I’ve received so many compliments for the thick, shiny, body hugging fabric on the pearl embellished short dresses. I have the dresses in white, black and waiting to purchase more colours next; I really want the lime green one if it’s released again 🌹The pieces are hand tailored, made in-house in London and keep their form and quality we ar after wear; they look amazing on my 5.10 model-physique friends, as well as my 5.3 hourglass figure; looks perfect on my super curvy friends; the pieces just adjust to any body type!They are pieces to wear for your lifetime celebrations and I also bring them on any vacation I go, as they look so beautiful on pictures as in reality! Truly can’t recommend enough as there’s no other high fashion brand like Khanums. An ethical brand designed- and made in London; unique pieces to keep for a lifetime.	2023-03-21	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6419a9d9a6a0092d76d81d7f	0.2993470418470418	neutral	["pieces", "dresses", "khanums", "brand", "friends", "super", "body", "celebrations", "lifetime", "tailored"]

Return policy isn’t clear either no refund given (just store credit) and if you would like to exchange and item you have to pay for delivery back to the store plus the delivery from the store back to you.

2622	khanums	Lana Kizy	BUYER BEWARE. DO NOT ORDER. I ordered a dress from them and was in constant communication with them as I needed my dress by a certain time. They have generic sizing so I knew I would need to alter prior to the wedding I was attending. I asked them if they would be able to ship by March 6 and they assured me. After asking for updates on shipping they didn’t end up shipping the item UNTIL MARCH 6Th. No apology. I received the dress Thursday evening allowing me one day (Friday) to tailor. What tailor do they think will drop everything they have to fix a dress in one day? It took them three damn weeks to make the dress and they expect their customers to adjust in one day? They are a scam company that does not care about customer service. As far as the quality of the dress it is so cheaply made I would never pay $500 for something like that. You are better off ordering from revolve and returning after you see the cheap quality. Now I am left with a garbage dress and -$500.Update: you guys are straight up liars. I have the emails. I told you my event was March 11th but needed the dress by the 6th so I can have enough time to alter the dress. You didn’t even ship it out until March 6th and I didn’t get the dress until Thursday evening where nobody was going to alter it for me in ONE DAY. You guys did absolutely nothing for my concerns and you are a horrible company.	2023-03-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/640b673eddeec2a86aef3ede	0.10816326530612248	neutral	["dress", "march", "one", "day", "would", "alter", "6th", "needed", "time", "ship"]

Already disappointed with the £15 delivery fee for the parcel to be sent within England (London - Sussex) the dress fitted well on the bottom half however the top ‘wrap’ does not cover my chest at all so I wouldn’t be wanting a size up. The company DO NOT OFFER REFUNDS as they say they are ‘made to order’ even though the dresses come in generic sizes (XS,S,M etc.) The company did offer me exchange or credit however after spending over £250 on a dress that fits so poorly I don’t wish to receive any other products, especially as I’d have to spend more money for a more expensive item or lose money on a cheaper one.	2023-02-15	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63fc9f9f08f2ce1b674d781d	-0.04416666666666667	neutral	["dress", "however", "company", "offer", "money", "ordered", "kara", "scarf", "already", "disappointed"]

It was boxed beautifully and came with a satin(?) bag to store it in, which just adds to the sense of it being a special item.I had put off buying it as the price point is high and I worried about whether it would feel 'worth it' but the item compares favourably (in many cases better) against designer items of a similar price point. It feels like a really special item that should be kept for decades, and is now probably one of the more luxurious feeling items in my wardrobe, so I think it works as an investment piece and I anticipate I will buy another piece.	2022-12-25	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63f72e256f3134764b71f9d1	0.33535714285714285	positive	["item", "one", "feels", "like", "special", "price", "point", "items", "piece", "received"]

I did read the return/exchange policy before buying because obviously it’s a big purchase and I completely agree with them as they are a small brand that is trying to prevent clothes from ending up in the landfill.

2661	khanums	MV	I realize that these products are handmade but the beading on the neckline in eyes sight is so crooked. It looks super cheap, which it was not. I reached out after the “return time” of seven days and there’s nothing they can do. Whoever responded said, “that’s the beauty of handmade” when referring to the dresses crooked stitching. Am I wrong to think that that is not the beauty of handmade? Handmade means you can catch details like crooked pearls that a machine cannot? The person helping was just super dismissive. Besides the neckline the rest of the dress looks pretty.	2022-12-30	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63af0b2b2338b6d417ab6dbe	0.10208333333333333	neutral	["handmade", "crooked", "neckline", "looks", "super", "beauty", "realize", "products", "beading", "eyes"]
2662	khanums	Sarah	I ordered the ‘Kara Scarf Dress’. When it arrived I tried it on and it barely covered my chest, I wouldn’t be able to wear it out (everything else fit, the cut of the dress was strange on me). Please bare in mind when ordering they do not offer refunds as everything is made to order (Although my dress arrived in three days). You will not get your money back, just a credit note which is valid for one year. The solution was to “custom make a dress to my measurements” at an additional £59.50 making the dress £312.50. I personally can’t afford this and don’t feel the quality is worth it. I do want to say that they were very quick in responding and tried to offer solutions, my only reason for posting is for others to not make my mistake and to avoid them being out of pocket as the dresses are very expensive and your are liable if you make the wrong choice (postage is also organised by the customer and it must be tracked. I will update this with my cost of returning.)	2022-09-11	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63238f9f7f7a8621ee5ce13e	0.033333333333333326	neutral	["dress", "make", "arrived", "tried", "everything", "offer", "ordered", "kara", "scarf", "barely"]

2688	postergirl	Katherine Mulinde	I ordered the Daphne jumpsuit in crypto blue. It's a beautiful two-tone color that would compliment a range of skin tones. Shipping was decent. I ordered with overnight shipping. I ordered in the morning on a Tuesday (9:30am EST), and received it on a Thursday. So it wasn't technically overnight, but 48 hours isn't too bad. Once it arrived, please be warned, if you try it on, you cannot return it! The company classifies this jumpsuit as hosiery and doesn't accept returns on the item, even if you only try it on. Unfortunately, I didn't like the jumpsuit. It's one size fits most. I'm fit (I'm a personal trainer), but I have a "moderate" bra-size. There's minimal to no support or coverage. Sure, it "fits", but it requires a lot of extra work to make it work for someone with my build. I think it's probably better suited for someone with a smaller cup size or someone with surgical breast enhancements.  Also, I wasn't a fan of the material. I've worn many outfits with cutouts from different companies and at similar price points. This is the first time I've felt like an outfit of this style could easily snag. To be fair, I didn't get to wear the jumpsuit to the event I wanted to (because I didn't like the jumpsuit) so I'm not sure how it would actually hold up with movement. I could be wrong and it holds up well, but this is how it feels to me upon only trying it on. Lastly, the outfit is advertised as having Crystal Heart buttons. I didn't see any in the photos, but it is listed in the description of the outfit. There are no crystal buttons. Poster Girl needs to correct that.	2024-05-28	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/666b03d123412176af20f250	0.09537037037037038	neutral	["jumpsuit", "didnt", "ordered", "like", "someone", "outfit", "would", "shipping", "overnight", "wasnt"]

I waited nearly a month with no update from customer service on my case. Well, fast forward to today and I messaged them back over email, Instagram asking about any news about my lost parcel. They refused to refund me for the lost package, despite me telling them repeatedly I didn’t receive the product and I don’t recognize the “proof of delivery” photo! Do not order from this company!

DPD sent my order to the wrong address, after speaking to DPD they checked and confirmed they'd delivered it to the wrong address and instructed me (with proof) to request a refund from Poster Girl. I did this, I then waited over a month and a half to get my refund issued. Posted girl we're 'investigating' this with DPD, even though I had proof FROM DPD myself.

2847	postergirl	Kristina Peeva	It's not cool to see a dress that I  purchased for almost 3k with shipping cost to magically go down to $900 dollars just within few weeks . Not displayed as discounted one either. So there is zero minimum hold value to this clothing brand . Returns are complicated on all orders coming from UK to the US. If something literally doesn't fit right the return cost is higher than the product in majority of the cases. Overall loved the creativity and designs of the brand but there is no good quality in their stuff either   ,everything I've bought so far wears super fast and it doesn't hold any value . I've ordered plenty of stuff in the past and never been really treated as high valued regular costumer, never offered free shipping on anything nor discounted code for something So , not cool.

2853	postergirl	Cheyanne	I love poster girl and I’m excited to see the clothes I ordered. The website is easy to use and I checked out quickly. My only issue is that I was excited to use the 10% for my first order but then that made my clothes just barely under $200 so the shipping went to $35 instead of free? It ended up being cheaper to not use the discount code. Also would really like to see more models in some of the clothes so I can get a better idea of how it will look on. Some of the models are wearing corsets or other accessories that cover up the entire piece I’m looking at. But I love the clothes and I’m super happy about the sale. Edit: I was also offered a 15% discount on my next order for leaving this review and I have yet to receive that.	2023-10-11	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/652b5af0535b3affe1dc646f	0.2995098039215686	neutral	["clothes", "use", "love", "excited", "see", "order", "discount", "also", "models", "poster"]

2971	postergirl	Isabella	I have wanted the Calypso dress since I saw it on Doja Cat in her music video, "Say so," 3 years ago.But I never managed to buy it, because it was out of my budget. This month I saw that Poster-Girl had a huge sale, so I managed to buy the dress for "only" 300 british pounds(plus 146 pounds for customs clearance,a total of 446 pounds for the dress.)I was super exicted, and it came fairly quickly, only after a day(all the way to Norway.)But the excitement soon turned to confusion and a feeling of beeing ripped off, as parts of the (really) pretty dress has loose threads, a really obvious zipper on the back, and kind of torn pieces underneath the zipper(as if someone have tried it on before me, were possibly too big for the dress, and tore it up a bit).I emailed the customer service the same day, and didn`t get a response for over a week. So, I sent a new email, and still haven`t heard anything. All I want is to exchange the dress, not even get a refund, I just want a dress that looks like what I paid for. I think it`s weird that Poster-Girl doesn`t care more about the customers, very unprofessional and it has left a bad taste in my mouth. I have followed this brand for a very long time, and have always admired their clothes...And now when I finally were able to buy one of their iconic dresses, I get a ruined dress and no response.3 years of wanting that dress.. It`s hurtful to be honest, no resepect for me as a paying customer.It seems to me like they are just waiting for the "2 week return possibility" to go away, so they can reject me later....Not that this will affect them, but I am not buying again in the future.EDIT: I got to return the dress, with the promise of a new one. When the dress was sent back, I suddenly got an email about a refund - because «the dress was no longer available.»Very weird.	2023-07-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64c05bd2aee48a1ea2a3a6ee	0.07979784583232859	neutral	["dress", "buy", "get", "saw", "years", "managed", "postergirl", "pounds", "really", "back"]

3078	postergirl	Melis	I ordered a top that was £79 and it arrived with one of the buttons already detached in the bag. I hadn't even tried it on yet. I emailed customer service within ONE HOUR of receiving the top and they suggested I sew the button back on with the kit the included (no kit was included in the parcel). Even if it was, I am confused as to why it is my responsibility to fix a brand new top I spent £80 after it was delivered faulty.For this price, this should not be happening after 6 months, let alone straight away.

3087	postergirl	Anna Harrison	If you take their dresses out of the bag they come in they are then NON RETURNABLE/NON REFUNDABLE which is completely ridiculous especially for ‘one size fits all’ dresses that are super expensive. So essentially you can only look at the dress through a plastic bag to decide if it fits right and looks good - taking it out of the bag means you can’t return it. I’d like to note no where on the website or on the bag or parcel itself stated this so I opened my 2 dresses and tried them on - one had rips and was really poorly made - I just didn’t like either though they were far too short for me and not a good fit at all. I requested to return them but as I said because I’d simply taken the dresses out the bag they came in I could no longer return them. I’ve wasted £350 + with this company. I’d avoid at all costs unless you are ok with losing your money.	2022-06-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62ae52ac266eedb3c15d52b7	0.033482142857142856	neutral	["bag", "dresses", "return", "one", "fits", "good", "like", "take", "come", "non"]

After wearing the dress for the first time one of the buttons came off as soon as I put the dress on. During the night the other two buttons had come off too. I sent an email to customer service and the best they could do is send replacement diamond buttons even after I had explained i still have the buttons and I would want a refund. Shows the quality of their products do not match the price tag but most importantly their customer service shows they do not care about their customers.

3094	ratboa	Alice Hammonds	I wish I had read the reviews on here before ordering from Rat & Boa. I ordered the Solaris dress, I wore it to a wedding and wow, it's stunning and I received so many compliments. I got the dress on sale and there was one slight tear on the bust but you couldn't really see it. Now, when I got home from the wedding (approximately 8 hours of wear) the fabric of the dress was scratched and torn in multiple places like the bum. So you literally can't even sit in a chair and eat a meal with this kind of dress?! It's obviously super fragile which I wouldn't expect for such a huge price tag. I was really disappointed and contacted Customer Care, it took about two weeks to even get a returns label. I'm now waiting for a response after posting the dress back but judging by the comments on here, I'm not getting my money back and I'm not even getting the dress back. I think this brand might sell the kind of garment that looks good when worn for a photo but you can't actually wear for a whole evening or event. Such a shame and now I'm about 200 euros down.	2025-05-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/686e0adf9bd92fca28d2381a	0.1277777777777778	neutral	["dress", "even", "back", "wedding", "got", "really", "wear", "cant", "kind", "getting"]

3096	ratboa	Alexa	I’m beyond frustrated with this brand. I ordered a dress from Rat & Boa over a week ago — for a specific event — and it STILL hasn’t been shipped.Their website clearly says that orders are dispatched the same day or the next working day. That is a lie. It’s been well over a week and all I have is a UPS tracking number that says “label created, but package not received.” That means they haven’t even handed it to the courier yet. So no, it’s not “on the way.” It’s just sitting somewhere with a label slapped on it.I’ve contacted them on every possible platform — WhatsApp (useless automated message that deletes every 24h), Instagram (they sent me to a random email), and email (no proper response, just a copy-pasted FAQ). Nobody is taking responsibility. It’s like they’re hiding behind automated replies hoping people will give up.This is a premium-priced brand, but the service is absolutely appalling. If you don’t have proper customer service, don’t charge premium prices. I have no idea if or when my dress will ever arrive, and no one is bothering to tell me anything. I’m now stressed, frustrated, and stuck without a dress for my event.Completely unacceptable experience. I will never order from them again and I’m warning others: if you’re ordering for an event or timeline, don’t risk it. It’s not worth the money or the stress.	2025-06-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/686cac47ecc0250e91f69d91	-0.22857142857142856	negative	["dress", "frustrated", "brand", "week", "event", "says", "day", "label", "every", "automated"]
3097	ratboa	Andrea Malinova	I don't understand the negative reviews of this brand. I've been ordering from them for about 6 years, in fact, it's the majority of my wardrobe. All the clothes are still like new, so they are high quality, they are original and different from other brands, they make a beautiful figure and are very feminine. But yes, I've also returned goods and I didn't have a problem with that either, I returned them and my money came back without me having to insist on anything. I never need to defend anyone, but in the case of this brand I'm sorry to see that someone writes negative things here, I think they are exaggerated, because it's impossible that out of so many of my orders, not one had a problem. This is the most beautiful women's clothing and I love this brand.	2025-07-04	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6867feb2eaf97b9f72a6b0ff	0.09880570409982174	neutral	["brand", "negative", "ive", "beautiful", "returned", "problem", "dont", "understand", "reviews", "ordering"]

3099	ratboa	Janice Smith	This company is a total disaster!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!! READ ALL THE REVIEWS ON TRUST PILOT AND SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE!!  I ordered a dress for my daughter’s wedding on 1st June to be delivered to Marbella.  It arrived to Malaga and stayed there for days and was untrackable after that.  UPS declared it lost. Told me to get back to the company.  I contacted Rat and Boa requesting a refund.  They said this could take some time to investigate.  This is not my problem!!  Refund my money, the dress didn’t arrive!!!  But I decided to order the same dress again for the wedding.  AGAIN!!! it didn’t arrive and I was then told on 16th June (one day before my daughters wedding) it was in a UPS Depot in Marbella. ( It was to be delivered to my house) I spent money on a taxi both ways to be told it wasn’t there and that this happens all the time with UPS. I was beyond disappointed.  I Now down approximately 700 eur 320 each dress plus taxi costs and NO DRESS!!! I had messaged Rat and Boa customer service daily pleading for any updates NOTHING!!! There is no such thing as customer service with this company.  They did not respond.  They want to charge you very high prices for dresses that do not arrive and will not deal with any issues regarding ANYTHING!!! Read the other reviews.  It is not just my experience.  This company is a scam company worse than any experience I have had with any of the Chinese ones ie Temu, SHEIN  both a dream to deal with.  After the weekend of the wedding I got a new notification from UPS that my first order had arrived in a different UPS depot in Marbella ( why not to my house as was ordered??) This is nearly 4 weeks after I ordered it and after I had been told the order was lost???? I spent 640 euros on two orders for my daughter’s wedding and neither of which arrived on time.  The total stress and frustration of dealing with a company with ZERO ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE, no phone number no way to contact them except by an email which they do not reply to….. Rat and Boa is a disgrace and should be closed down.   The company obviously does not care one iota for it’s customers.  I want my refund and judging from other horrendous reviews, I will be waiting.  They deny returns arrive etc.  I will initiate a charge back from my card company if I do not hear from them very shortly.  In short  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.  You will regret it…	2025-06-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/685d3dd687d89b19185e467e	-0.075989898989899	neutral	["company", "dress", "wedding", "ups", "told", "arrive", "reviews", "ordered", "marbella", "arrived"]

3103	ratboa	Yasmin Paget	Please can you let me know how I can make a formal complaint regarding the service I have received from your customer service team. Not only did it take them over four days to originally come back to me with a generic message , each time I have sent a message on the WhatsApp chat it then takes a further 24 hours for them to respond to me each time, Making it near enough impossible to resolve any problems. I find it unbelievable that a brand like yourselves do not have a telephone number  or a customer services team cannot escalate certain queries to make sure they get resolved much quicker. Please note, I’ve also tried to contact you on your live chat which each time says available when it’s clearly not and also I’ve sent emails.I have received a dress that has clearly been worn before it smells and has a hole in it. This is not acceptable when paying nearly £300 for a dress. All that has been offered to me is that you will give me 20% off the damaged dress which I don’t think is acceptable. Even with 20% off, I don’t see why I should have to pay that much money for a dress that is not in perfect condition. I am so Disappointed as this dress was for my Hen do. I appreciate mistakes happen, However, the customer service that I have received since receiving the dress has left a really sour taste my mouth. I don’t think it’s acceptable to leave your customers waiting so long until you reply or when you do reply, reply with the most generic response possible!  Then only offer a 20% discount for a dress that smells and has a hole in it. I’ll be really grateful if someone can come back to me as soon as possible. I’m getting nowhere with your customer service team so thought I would try and reach out on this email address with the hope of speaking to someone. 289661	2025-06-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68541458b271293f7b52683c	0.058354280128473685	neutral	["dress", "service", "customer", "received", "team", "time", "acceptable", "reply", "please", "make"]

3107	ratboa	κάλη βρεττού	very disappointed i have ordered two dresses for a wedding from the end of April , because of an internal issue of their system the delivery andress have not be placed in the label so the ups return the parcel to them and they refund me the money, and i tried again for second time to make the order at the end of may , the parcel left from netherlands on 26/05 and have been lost in London from 27/05 ( i do not know why the parcel was found in London because it is opposite as the final destination is Greece) and i have started a try to communicate at the same time with rat and boa and ups it is 16/06 no parcel yet it is in london i don't know what else to do rat and boa needs at least 3 working days to respond and they tell me nothing to help me , no phone to contact them i imagine why they are very amateurs i am very disappointed and i have never exprerienced this again	2025-06-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68501eb44fc333db5b795fda	-0.20500000000000002	negative	["parcel", "london", "disappointed", "end", "ups", "time", "know", "rat", "boa", "ordered"]
3108	ratboa	Maggie	Ordered a dress advertised as Non-Sheer and it was see through. For a $300+ dress you would think the quality would be better. The fit was great but the dress felt like a pool cover up that you could get at Target. I went to return the dress and it would cost $160 to return to the UK.

3109	ratboa	Sophie Armstrong	I bought the Beliza dress for a wedding and unfortunately I was really let down with the quality of the dress. I would expect this quality from boohoo or similar brands but not of a company charging hundreds of pounds for their dresses. They are single lined, cheap material which pulled before I could even wear it. The seams are all puckered along each side which just shows what poor craftsmanship is put into the clothing pieces. A far cry from the high quality that this brand claims. Despite this I decided to wear the dress anyway as I had nothing else to wear to my friends wedding. Approximately 5 hours into the wedding the strap broke, which left me at risk of exposure during a formal event. I had to resort to pinning the strap with a safety pin for the remainder of the evening.After inspecting the dress following that single disastrous wear, I found multiple areas where the material had pulled, and the stitch work throughout the dress is appalling. A garment becoming faulty within five hours of wear is unacceptable and renders it legally faulty. After the event I contacted Rat & Boa's customer care email and I was replied to by Shannon who was very helpful and in this case I was granted a full refund quickly. If you are looking for a quality piece of clothing you can wear time and time again, look elsewhere. You will not find it at Rat and Boa.	2025-06-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6848081a1ba45db11b007ea4	-0.012146636432350729	neutral	["wear", "dress", "quality", "wedding", "single", "material", "pulled", "clothing", "hours", "strap"]

3138	ratboa	Anna	Quite saddened to be writing this review as I was so excited to receive my order number 274109 which I paid over £800 for but have still not received since placing it on the 18/02/2025. I was away for a few days while the courier attempted delivery but I thought they would contact me to re-arrange this when they noticed no one was at home but instead they left the parcel unattended, outside, by the bins during a time of torrential rain without any authorisation from me to do so. My property is located in London by a public footpath, road and tube station. It is not safe to leave parcels unattended and even if it was, I had not authorised the courier to do so. My contract agreed with Rat & Boa stated this parcel had to be signed for, which it wasn’t. The courier re-visited the property and I spoke to the driver who confirmed that he had left the parcel unattended and now doesn’t know where it is. I am shocked that an order of this value was just dumped by the bins in the rain without authorisation (but that's so far not necessarily the retailer's fault). However I have tried to resolve this with Rat & Boa but they have failed to re-deliver my goods or refund my money and now they are no longer responding to me. It has been nearly a month since this order was placed, the goods are no longer needed and the occasion they were ordered for has passed. I have tried to assist Rat & Boa with all the information they needed, I waited for weeks for them to resolve this with DHL but now I'm being ignored while they've kept nearly £1k of my money for goods I haven't received. Really didn't think this would be my experience when I placed the order.	2025-03-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67cef3636da0ffbd65c131bf	-0.024999999999999998	neutral	["order", "courier", "parcel", "unattended", "rat", "boa", "goods", "received", "since", "would"]

3140	ratboa	Ryan	I spent over $550 on just two dresses for my girlfriend, only to be hit with an unexpected $150+ in duties fees. There was zero communication from Rat and Boa about this prior, so I had no idea I’d be charged extra until it was too late.When I tried to reach out for help, the customer service's communication was awful. They respond once a day, and their “live chat” is basically nonexistent and does not connect to any representative. By the time I got a response on WhatsApp, I had no choice but to pay the duties just to receive the package.To make things worse, the dress doesn’t even fit properly, even though we followed their size chart my girlfriend couldnt even try it on because its double her size at a Size Small. Given the price, lack of transparency, and bad customer service, this was extremely disappointing, and saddening. I've shopped at Saks Fifth, Nordstrom, among a bunch of other direct luxury retailers and never had this happen.	2025-03-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67caa4abdd20154bea1e0fd6	-0.15241477272727272	negative	["even", "size", "girlfriend", "duties", "communication", "customer", "spent", "550", "two", "dresses"]
3141	ratboa	Jovana Lea Salkić	EditWhat an awful practice to mislead with untruthful replies on TP. I posted the original review and within 2 hours received tracking details. It’s so sad that only a bad review and mention of the bank promt you to reply. On top of everything, dress received is so obviously faulty that it makes me think the sale was just to tey and get rid of the faulty pieces. Let’s see how long it’ll take RB to process the return request.OriginalI ordered dresses for next day delivery 3 days ago, order 279265, however, I received no delivery, no updates, no tracking number. What is going on? Where is my order?I’m writing this review to warn other shoppers of the scam. The delay itself would not warrant this review, but the complete lack of contact/customer service does. I tried contacting this company on all platforms available, haven’t received a single response or automatic update on the status of my order.It’s so disappointing as one of the dresses I waited for over a year to be in stock, I was in love with it and decided to treat myself. It’s just one of those things where you have to accept you made a mistake judging the legitimacy of company’s positive reviews and online presence, and now have to deal with the bank to sort this out while these fraudsters hold your money.	2025-03-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67c837aa0d902e089d48bea6	-0.05900974025974025	neutral	["review", "received", "tracking", "bank", "faulty", "dresses", "delivery", "company", "one", "editwhat"]

Over the weekend I have contacted you on a separate matter which has been addressed. Since this morning I have contacted you "on multiple platforms" asking about my delivery which should have been done today yet it hasn't even been dispatched yet. No reply at all, not even one to politely and succinctly say what you have found the time to say HERE, which is that sales times are busy and ask for my patience. The fact that it has been done solely as a reply to my review and not on my chat, email, Whatsapp attempts to contact you, speaks volumes about the priority for the business you represent: public impressions, not customer satisfaction!I am all for fairness, please believe me, as a customer service employee myself. But I will not stand for the audacity of being told "your review is neither fair nor accurate", when you haven't even had the decency to send a quick, short reply to my attempts to contact you, asking for my patience like you do here, while playing the victim.Please support your customers and answer their queries before you label them "not fair, nor accurate".

3153	ratboa	Alex Meffert	My very honest review:I really love their styles. They are very unique and really check all the boxes. In terms of sizing, it is sometimes better to size up, because the materials are sometimes not very stretchy and everything is a bit on the tighter side.The materials are often synthetic, which is not what I dream of. My ordering and delivery process has always been fast and easy.No I have had the same experience others have described when it comes to returns during flash sales. It has not been possible to receive an item fast enough and return it (when it was too small), to then order the proper size during a sale. And I did only receive a voucher/store credit for my return. So I thought, I will just wait for another flash sale to buy the item in my size, with the discount and pay with my voucher. But my voucher only lasted one year, and I ended up buying the item, full price. That being said, I still love their styles and order from them, as I find them very unique and flattering.	2024-12-12	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6783ad64c8104ef80a747317	0.2141666666666667	neutral	["size", "item", "really", "love", "styles", "unique", "sometimes", "materials", "fast", "flash"]
3154	ratboa	Ana de Miquel	I ordered a jacket during the sales period, but unfortunately, it was too big. While I appreciated the option to return it, the return process took so long that by the time I received my voucher, the sales had ended. Now, I have a voucher, but I can't repurchase the jacket without paying full price, which is very frustrating.I wish the return process had been faster or that the voucher could reflect the original sale price to allow for a fair exchange. This experience has made me hesitant about shopping during sales again. I hope the store considers improving this aspect of their service.	2024-10-09	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/677fc810d483d768d0587a9d	0.159375	neutral	["sales", "return", "voucher", "jacket", "process", "price", "ordered", "period", "unfortunately", "big"]

3158	ratboa	Agos	I purchased a dress from Rat & Boa for €350, expecting premium quality given the price point and the brand's reputation. Unfortunately, the reality was far from that. The fabric began catching and pulling before I even arrived at the event. In fact, it was catching on the upholstery of my car during transport.When I contacted their customer service and provided evidence, I was met with a dismissive response claiming the damage was due to "wear and tear" and not a manufacturing fault. Let me be clear: this happened before I even wore the dress for its intended purpose. The fabric quality is absolutely not what they advertise, and their lack of accountability is astonishing.To make matters worse, after refusing to offer any meaningful resolution, such as a repair, replacement, or partial refund, they had the audacity to send me a €25 voucher for my "next purchase" (as if I’d ever buy from them again!) and continue bombarding me with newsletters every two days.This experience has been beyond disappointing. Not only do I not recommend this brand, but I will also actively share my experience with others. Word of mouth is powerful, and unfortunately, I have nothing good to say about Rat & Boa.If you value quality and customer service, I suggest you look elsewhere.PS: After leaving this review, the brand replied with the exact same copy-paste response they sent me via email. This only proves that Rat & Boa has zero focus on customer experience and no interest in actually resolving issues for their customers.	2024-11-22	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6767f3548e04866f8da32ed7	0.0431159420289855	neutral	["rat", "quality", "customer", "experience", "dress", "boa", "unfortunately", "fabric", "catching", "even"]
3159	ratboa	Charlotte	Awful customer service and quality of delivery. My order came and the dress came crumpled and with the gold chain all twisted and labels crumpled like it had been tried on a few times. Not what you would expect for a dress that’s over £150. When I contacted customer service the best they could do was offer me a £25 voucher for my future purchase - insulting and not likely I’ll ever purchase from them again. When asked if they could refund that for the inconvenience, hassle and quality they said no. To make matters worse they said that they would give a free returns if they deemed the item faulty - again laughable! I won’t be shopping from here again and will be telling all my friends about the awful experience.	2024-12-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67605435ab9ae90a98618761	-0.3022727272727273	negative	["awful", "customer", "service", "quality", "came", "dress", "crumpled", "would", "could", "purchase"]

3161	ratboa	SHussain	Rat and Boa used to be my favorite brand - great designs, good quality, and fair prices. I remember buying the white and red Desert Rose beach dresses for £75 each. Now, bikini bottoms alone can cost over £100. Sadly, the brand has completely lost its appeal. Since becoming mainstream, the designs aren’t nearly as flattering or well-thought-out, and most of the clothes are see through. To make it worse, the prices are ridiculous for items that are mostly polyester or barely wearable. It’s obvious the founders are more focused on making money than the quality that made the brand special. Save your money, it’s not worth it anymore.	2024-12-04	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6750877ecf85561e16e2500d	0.2236904761904762	neutral	["brand", "designs", "quality", "prices", "money", "rat", "boa", "used", "favorite", "great"]

I own so many of their pieces, and some of the older ones, especially the silk dresses, are buttery smooth and absolutely worth the price. However, the newer designs just don’t measure up.The Camile and Magdalena dresses, with their beautiful layered designs, were truly stunning. I also adore the Assisi dress for its double layers in the chest area, which add elegance and provide better coverage. Unfortunately, many of the recent dresses feel a bit too sheer by comparison, which is a letdown.	2024-11-20	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/673da09aedd81cb85f724473	0.24791666666666667	neutral	["dresses", "many", "designs", "always", "loved", "brand", "lately", "disappointed", "prices", "gone"]

The dresses drape and fall so well on every body type-I wish they would proudly show this to eveyone on their advertising/social media more. This is the 4th Rat & Boa dress i’ve ordered living in Sydney Australia and delivery times have been super quick each time. I suspect this might be because they have a hub in Australia somewhere. Although i look after my dresses well, they have not been torn as some people sadly have experienced. I haven’t had the need to contact the customer service team for any reason as yet so I can’t really comment on the customer service component of the business this is because the dresses feel beautiful on me and delivery has been so good eveytime which is a dream.	2024-11-09	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/672ebbb194b1fd286035bc33	0.45166666666666666	positive	["dresses", "ordered", "dress", "well", "australia", "delivery", "customer", "service", "valentina", "recently"]

I have noticed a decrease in quality and increase in prices this year. Older pieces feel so much better quality than my last purchases that are so fragile, that one of them when I tried it for the first time got ripped. Another thing you should take care when ordering is the sizing. Things run really really small. Other than that amazing shipping, I might say one of the best stores regarding this matter. things look really good on every body type, just don’t expect them to last forever because attention to detail is just falling down.

3180	ratboa	Danielle Edwards	I’ll be honest, the dress is stunning but it’s not worth the money. I have worn this to 2 weddings and I’m very disappointed with the quality of this dress. It is SO fragile that you feel like you can’t move without it ripping or tearing. When I bought it, the material around the zip was already a bit fragile so I wasn’t impressed but I gave it the benefit of the doubt. It’s like tissue paper and rips very easily. So much so that at the end of the night I’ve looked down to see two massive rips in the dress after dancing and can’t understand where they came from. I’m a size 12 and have worn a large and would say this dress is DEFINITELY not for a woman who is more than a size 10.

3181	ratboa	Daniella Vs	I own around 70% of their collection, and while I appreciate the unique designs and styles, I've noticed significant variability in quality across different products and even within the same sizes.For example, the Farah dress in size M fits more like an S, while the Opium dress in size M fits perfectly. Additionally, I recently ordered the Magnolia dress in size S, which arrived in orange ,but my new order in size M came in red. This inconsistency has been quite disappointing, especially considering my loyalty to the brand. Additionally, the return process has proven to be quite challenging, particularly due to customs expenses, which complicates things further. It often feels like a game of Russian roulette when purchasing, as I’m unsure whether the item will meet the quality I expect.	2024-10-03	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66fe4bbaf216b16dc8a18347	0.13890374331550803	neutral	["size", "dress", "quality", "fits", "like", "additionally", "quite", "around", "collection", "appreciate"]

I ordered some dresses to try on for a wedding in Italy and they ended up getting stuck with DHL (technical reasons). Because of this, I didn't receive the dresses in time and had to leave for Italy before they passed through DHL and arrived at my home. I was in Italy for over a month and emailed Rat and Boa letting them know that I didn't receive the dresses in time for my event and would like to return them, however it would be past their 30 day return window since I was out of the country. They were incredibly understanding and allowed me to still return them. They were also incredibly quick with their responses and very detail oriented in working through the DHL problem. I have to recommend this brand for the level of customer service and the way you feel completely taken care of through the shopping experience.	2024-09-24	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66f2e809c8641dd6c08f171c	0.2703703703703704	neutral	["leave", "dresses", "italy", "dhl", "return", "customer", "service", "didnt", "receive", "time"]
3189	ratboa	Rachael	I never go out of my way to write bad reviews but I’m honestly shocked by the customer service of this brand. The dress I bought (Athena) is £235. For this price you expect quality and I tried on the dress when it arrived- when worn the bottom of the zip on the side is bulky and poorly made, so that it sticks out as an odd shape on my hip, instead of what should be a seamless sillouette. The material is also thin and see through. Now I’m in the process of returning the item, the return has to have a photo with it before you’re allowed to continue - which again I think is ridiculous - and now my return is ‘submitted for review’. For the price point the quality is poor and customer service even worse. You should be able to return clothes you buy online for obvious reasons and I don’t think a company should make a customer jump through hoops to return an unworn item.I would honestly never buy from this brand again and do not recommend.	2024-09-20	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66edc4a1cb4e5368a4d4d3ba	-0.26666666666666666	negative	["return", "customer", "never", "honestly", "service", "brand", "dress", "price", "quality", "think"]
3190	ratboa	Catherine Keevil	Bought a dress in Feb 24. Didn't inspect it.  Put it away to keep for my cruise I had booked. It's still got all the tags on and in the Rat and Boa bag. I've come to pack for my cruise in a few days and I've noticed the zip has been sewed on wrong. As the zip has been sewed on, some loose cotton has got wrapped around the zip and this has casued fraying of the material around the zip. Updated ReviewI emailed customer service who are replacing the dress for me. Can't fault their customer service. They have been so quick in replying to me and sorting the issue.	2024-09-14	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66e5ea7d1c3447da3bdadd3d	-0.11089743589743588	negative	["zip", "dress", "cruise", "got", "ive", "sewed", "around", "customer", "service", "bought"]

3192	ratboa	Kelly	Love the sexy flattering fits of the dresses and bikini’s, it’s very feminine and hard to find elsewhere. Only criticism I would have is that I wish there was a Petite option for the dresses :). I’m 160cm and even with killer platform heals the dresses are way too long. When making it shorter the nice mermaid shape is mostly cut off plus you notice its made for slightly taller upperbody’s for a perfect fit. Also the back is shorter than the front (which makes it harder to adjust the length evenly).	2024-09-11	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66e1c9bad3ed265bdc7a4989	0.256547619047619	neutral	["dresses", "shorter", "love", "sexy", "flattering", "fits", "bikini", "feminine", "hard", "find"]

3201	ratboa	Oana Chitescu	I have written a very good review on Sept 3 2021 saying so far so great and how much I was enjoying R&B and at the time they were scoring above 4.5 on Trustpilot. I come back here today to write another review and was not at all surprised to see their score is now 3.9. Shameful. Whoever is in charge of their business approach needs to be held accountable. I have just received an email to say I have been DOWNGRADED from a Level 3 customer back to a level 1. Spending big amounts years ago got me to level 3 and was just pennies shy of level 4 but haven't made any significant purchases in a long time because of the aftermath of Covid. I'm only guessing (because your email didn't say) that the reason for being DOWNGRADED is my lack of spending on the website lately. Shameful. Never have I ever been "downgraded" as a customer. Appalled by your business approach, after already once changing your points system to a customer unfriendly one, now you downgrade people. Disgusted.I have already emailed you and said I will HAPPILY come back as a customer when new management comes on."Downgraded" because (I guess) I haven't made purchases in a while.

3204	ratboa	Pam	I bought a dress from Rat&Boa but I had to return it. The dress arrived but they issued my refund as a credit to the store saying that there was an option selected the refund to be as a credit. I cannot recall selecting an option like this. They want to deduct if transfer to my bank £4 for the return label. I am quite dissatisfied with their process at the moment and the slow customer service. They haven’t notified Klarna yet for the rerun and it’s been 4 days already since they received the dress. I doubt I will order anything else from Rat&Boa. They need to fix their customer service otherwise they will face complaints all the time.	2024-08-07	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66b3340f93c14c9aabd99948	-0.30000000000000004	negative	["dress", "ratboa", "return", "refund", "credit", "option", "customer", "service", "bought", "arrived"]
3205	ratboa	Tanya Loncar	Unfortunately, the quality of the dress I ordered was diabolical for £278. The sequins were off of the dress in the bag and falling onto the floor when I I had it on. I lasted no more than half an hour in it with people picking up the sequins and handing them to me. I had to return it to be told that this was my fault and because I wore a bag with it? Apparently they hand sew these on and they deem it acceptable to have the dress basically falling apart upon arrival never mind trying it on and to wear it. I had to take it off and change. I’ve been denied a refund for a clearly poorly made and bad quality Garment as ‘wear and tear!’ Which you’d think any reputable company would know isn’t acceptable to do so. Disappointing, wouldn’t recommend using them quality wise or company wise as their customer care experience has also been awful following this sadly!	2024-08-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66af686a2bb197f8f2727476	-0.18974358974358976	negative	["quality", "dress", "sequins", "bag", "falling", "acceptable", "wear", "company", "wise", "unfortunately"]

3209	ratboa	Drea Dz	I have had issues with this company since October 2023. I bought a dress for my birthday which I wore once to my birthday meal. It ripped the one time that I wore it. After I contacted the customer service team for a return or a replacement (as I really liked the dress), they told me that they wouldn’t issue a refund nor a replacement as the damage must have been as a result of wear and tear. I only wore the dress once to a restaurant and was sitting down the entire time. As they have said with other responses to the reviews here, they claimed that their materials are delicate and the damage must have been from stepping on the dress in heels with the dress being too long (the dress stopped at my ankles). After multiple back and forths, they told me they could give me store credit. I had to accept this as there were no other options. After buying and returning multiple dresses which were terrible quality and the sizing was inconsistent, I finally found one dress which I have kept, but is still BooHoo quality. I thought this was the end of my issues with Rat and Boa.In April I asked them to delete multiple accounts (and data) I had for their website. I was told this was taken care of and deleted, and then subsequently ended up receiving more marketing emails in May. I also then realised my accounts were all still active. In May I once again asked for my data to be deleted and asked for written confirmation once this was done. Once again, I was given an apology and told my accounts were deleted. It is now July, and I have received marketing emails. I have had to file a formal complain to the ICO just for Rat and Boa to *hopefully* one day delete my data.I had to make an account on TrustPilot just to write this review. I have never had such a terrible experience with a company and their unprofessionalism regarding data protection is honestly shocking. Please do not order anything from this company. They are overpriced, terrible quality, and overall awful to communicate with.	2024-07-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/668a9bafb90914bde34ade95	-0.20006038647342994	negative	["dress", "told", "company", "wore", "one", "multiple", "terrible", "quality", "asked", "accounts"]

All I can say is that I will never be buying from this store again, which is a pity because the clothing’s design is very nice but the overall experience was underwhelming.	2024-04-08	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/665d0878ed0f94c1d532f1d1	-0.08875000000000002	neutral	["pant", "clothing", "ripped", "unfortunately", "fabric", "quality", "meant", "used", "way", "expensive"]

3225	ratboa	HappyCustomer	Before purchasing from Rat & Boa, I sifted through numerous customer reviews, encountering both positive and negative feedback. Despite the mixed opinions, my desire to own a dress from Rat & Boa outweighed any uncertainty. Opting for the purchase, I received the dress within an impressive two days, even with international shipping. However, upon trying it on, the size wasn't quite right, prompting an exchange for a larger size.Throughout this process, I maintained active communication with Rat & Boa's customer service team, who promptly addressed my inquiries within a day. Despite the initial sizing issue, their swift response and assistance made the exchange hassle-free. Returning the ill-fitting dress was straightforward, with the package reaching them within seven days, tracked for peace of mind.Upon receiving the larger size, which fit perfectly, I was pleased with the product's quality and design. Importantly, I was informed promptly via email that the return had been processed successfully, with a full refund issued within just four days.It's worth noting that any additional expenses mentioned by some customers are transparently outlined on Rat & Boa's website. While their terms may seem lengthy, they provide comprehensive clarity to ensure a smooth shopping experience. Those expressing dissatisfaction likely overlooked these details, instead attributing their frustration to the company.In conclusion, my experience with Rat & Boa was positive, thanks to their efficient customer service and transparent policies. Any misconceptions or grievances stem from a lack of thorough review rather than any hidden agendas on the company's part.	2024-05-01	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/663f20afc2c362891c0a48f7	0.2566103896103896	neutral	["rat", "within", "boa", "customer", "dress", "positive", "despite", "days", "size", "exchange"]

3228	ratboa	Maria	I have been shopping at rat and boa for years, so I think I can leave an honest review.Pros: Beautiful styles, will suit all bodies.Cons: The quality of the clothes is not that good, the non-see-through dresses are a little see-through, and if you take the prices into consideration, what you spend doesn't match what you get.What needs work the most are dresses with sequins, they fall off very quickly, they can be delicate; but not to the point that its mere placement implies that they are destroyed.The worst thing the company has done is change its loyal customer policy, they give less benefits than before, it is too unfair.I really hope you take these points into consideration, I honestly have to reconsider my relationship with the brand.Three stars for all the years of relathionship.	2024-04-23	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/663242c278ca7b9071bde41d	0.15865384615384612	neutral	["years", "dresses", "take", "consideration", "shopping", "rat", "boa", "think", "leave", "honest"]

3231	ratboa	Me	I wrote to the support team because I wanted to buy a dress that was no longer available on their website, asking if there was any chance they still had a few left. They found one really quickly and the exchange with them was very efficient, friendly, informative and overall pleasant. The dress that I bought was as expected and the fabric felt comfortable! It was my gift to smo else and they loved everything about it. I would gladly buy from Rat & Boa again. The only thing I'd be able to criticise is the packaging. I expect smt more luxurious when I spent that much money on a dress than a bag made of starch but I understand that it makes delivery cheaper and easier. Delivery was very quick also!	2024-04-21	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/662536a2d5b706b0de55bba9	0.28240740740740744	neutral	["dress", "buy", "delivery", "wrote", "support", "team", "wanted", "longer", "available", "website"]

The dresses are one of a kind and make you feel beautiful and empowered when you wear it. I also love that RB dresses can be worn out to dinner and to more formal events and also on vacation.

I emailed the customer care team two days ago because I had a lost a button on my dress and had also lost the replacement. Within an hour of me sending my initial email the lovely Demi had responded and already attached a tracking number for a new button. I was expecting to pay for it (even just a small amount) as it was entirely my fault I needed one but it was so kindly sent to me for free and it’s already arrived! I cannot stress how impressed I am with the efficiency and care provided even just for such a small issue. Thank you so much to the team, it’s the little details that take a good brand to a great one.	2024-04-04	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6610a89d84f78d46887dfea5	0.30771464646464647	positive	["review", "brand", "great", "care", "team", "lost", "button", "already", "even", "small"]

Exceptional customer service!The dress itself is absolutely gorgeous - feels really high quality and clings in all the right places. I am not a super tan, super leggy model like a lot of the photos on the website show the dresses on so I was worried it might not fit well, but it’s safe to say these dresses look great on everyone!

What’s worse is that it said there were 8 or so of the item and size left when I placed my order. They blamed a fault with their website but I think that people who ordered the same item and size after me probably had their order fulfilled… Bad service in my opinion!

When I inquired when my package was going to be delivered, as I had heard nothing, I was told that it wouldn't be delivered. They didn't apologise at all, instead they explained that "Next Day Delivery" doesn't mean the next day from when you order, it means the day after the items are dispatched, which could be several days away depending on how busy they are. What?!?!It doesn't say that anywhere when you check out - it says "For next-day delivery, order before 2pm".

3263	ratboa	b.alex	I ordered a dress and had an email from royal mail to say it was due to be delivered whilst i was on holiday however the email said it would require a signature and with no one home, i assumed this would be re-delivered. It wasn't and the post man left the parcel hanging out of a letter box (no idea which house it was) and it was signed for by 'karl' - not myself or a neighbour. I raised this with Rat and Boa who after quizzing me about the delivery, have refused to open an investigation with royal mail until i provide a photo of my post box to prove that the parcel wasn't left there - totally missing the point that even if this had been left hanging out of our post box, it can easily be stolen and it was supposed to be signed for! I wouldn't expect that a nearly £200 dress would be left like that. Rat and Boa customer service has been most unhelpful and they clearly think I'm lying hence why they wont open an investigation without me sending a photo of my post box. Aside from the fact i shouldn't have to do this as the royal mail tracking shows how the parcel was delivered etc, I'm now away again and wont be able to send a photo for at least another week, further delaying the issue being resolved. Terrible service and i have had to raise the issue with Klarna to ensure nothing is paid to them.	2024-02-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65cf42b0107a249d74486123	0.0072916666666666685	neutral	["post", "left", "box", "royal", "mail", "would", "parcel", "photo", "dress", "email"]

3284	ratboa	Sacha Shaw	I always use Rat & Boa for any event I have. I just say the customer service and the quality of the garments can be absolutely shocking. On more than one occasion have I received damaged goods and had the whole back and forth. This last particular occasion was by far the worst. I ordered a dress for my best friends wedding! I tried it on and loved it, although the top half clearly wasn’t made for ladies that have boobs, I loved how I looked. After travelling to the venue and having makeup and hair done, I put my dress on only for my makeup artist to tell me there was a huge rip in the back. Something I wouldn’t have noticed on my own as it was on the back behind my knees. The wedding was an hour away and luckily I had a basic black dress that was from the pre wedding dinner the night before so sadly I had to wear that. A wedding that’s been such a big deal for so long with one of my oldest friends and I have to wear the same dress on both evenings which was quite deforesting as I’d spent a lot of money on the dress I wanted to wear from rat & boa. Straight away I emailed them expelling what had happened! They apologised and asked me to return asap which I did. I then waited nearly two weeks to even have a reply from them where they proceeded to tell me it was my fault and they didn’t do it (not sure how that works) and that they would send my dress back to me and they were done with the situation. It’s been a month since and I’ve still not received my faulty dress back from them! It feels very wrong that as a customer you have no rights or say especially when the product costs such a large amount and you couldn’t wear it anyway. This isn’t the first time I’ve had issues as I bought swimwear that came in a black bin liner and smelt to high heaven of cigarettes. I’m not sure why I keep ordering from this place as they clearly don’t care about the customer.	2023-09-22	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6549ff856135820da35f0b60	0.038936877076411976	neutral	["dress", "back", "wedding", "wear", "customer", "rat", "boa", "say", "one", "occasion"]

3302	ratboa	Jade Bonhomme	This was my first time ordering from this company. I work with a large publishing and media conglomerate on fashion posts and ads and we decided to pull some pieces from this brand for a project we’re working on. When the package arrived, it only contained 1 of the items we ordered. The rest of the parcel just contained extra packaging The area I am in was impacted by hurricane Idalia, and I was left without power for a week. By the time I was able to reach out to the company about the dilemma, they said they would conduct an investigation. I was so upset and disappointed when their “investigation” basically told me that I was lying and that they couldn’t do anything. We spent almost $500! What kind of customer service is that?! And by looking at these reviews I can see that I am not the only one who has experienced this. Seeing as we don’t actually have the order, perhaps we will write about our experience with this brand in our article instead. Highly do not recommend. It’s interesting to see how these up and coming brands treat their customers, especially when they don’t know who they’re actually dealing with.	2023-09-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64fd2a31affa9f1f4b012ce3	0.12870535714285714	neutral	["time", "company", "brand", "contained", "investigation", "see", "actually", "first", "ordering", "work"]

Spent $500 on this dress for an event coming up. Had to email asking what’s going on with sending me a replacement, which they definately had my size still there a couple of days after I sent back so I assumed as it’s their stuff up they would sent a replacement straight away. Emailed me back 3 days later saying the dress is now sold out. Worst customer service for a product you spend so much money on. I was devastated as I had my heart set on that dress. I found another on their website that was in stock and emailed them saying can they send that one as the one originally sent is sold out and they replied all we can do is send a refund or swap for the same dress. So much stuffing around, event is next week and have nothing to wear. I would probably say clear of this company.

3323	ratboa	Tyra Nawaz	This is the 2nd time I have ordered from this brand and I absolutely love the cut and design of their clothing. I have taken time to read the reviews and disagree that cheap fabrics are used i purchase from PLT and all the usual high street brands who do use fabrics like Rat & Boa but the cut is what separates them and alot of their designs are designed to flow on your body and thts exactly what they do.

3330	ratboa	Chloe Burdass	I want to start by saying that I have purchased several Rat&Boa dresses 2+ years ago, and that I love them all. This month I purchased their Azzara Dress. The item arrived and sadly did not fit, being a very strange design (the neck tie doesn't successfully hold the dress up without strangling you...), but bizarrely the item arrived with the tag already detached. I returned the item and reported the detached tags to the Rat&Boa customer care team. They responded saying that the item had significant signs of wear, which was complete news to me as I quite obviously could not wear it (even if it fit, the dresses are so long that I have previously had to get all taken up by a seamstress). I have spent a week pouring a lot of time and effort into pleading my innocence, to be met with the same response that Rat&Boa "quality check their products" meaning it could not be their fault that the item had signs of damage. I am now receiving back to me a faulty dress, which I have zero use for, and losing £200. The whole experience has been extremely unpleasant, feels like a scam, and I am losing a significant amount of money for an error on Rat&Boa's behalf. Will never be buying from here again, and would urge anyone to think twice about purchasing in future. Awful experience. I've now read several reviews below also saying they've been sent damaged and clearly worn products and then been refused a refund. Big big scam.	2023-07-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64ba84e1c85ff3a875d737f4	0.018733333333333334	neutral	["item", "saying", "ratboa", "dress", "purchased", "several", "dresses", "arrived", "fit", "detached"]

3332	ratboa	Dina Imamovic	The customer service is good, but the problem is the delay in delivery. I have made my order on 4th of July, and I needed my dress to arrive until the 22nd of July, as I was a maid of honor on a wedding. The dress never arrived, they kept saying that they have technical issues, without ever giving me the exact day of the delivery. They gave me a EUR 20 discount on my next order for me to feel better for not receiving the dress I paid for EUR 250,which is outrageous. For a company in this price category,they must have better and more reliable deliveries. Now, after waiting for 14 days for my order to arrive, I don't have any dress option last minute.

3344	ratboa	Juan Salas	Ordered a dress for my wife on a monday for an overseas wedding on a friday, and paid extra for express delivery. Delivered on Wednesday via DHL signed to a completely different address, and signed by a person that was not the parcel recipient. It's OK, it can happen, however when we explained the situation they still said they had to wait for a DHL internal investigation before they could outline next steps. It is now thursday, DHL confirmed that it won't be solved today, and now my wife has no dress for her wedding. Still, they have no urgency or care to solve this in time. Would give them 0 stars if I could.UPDATE: Incredibly, they won't even issue a refund until DHL concludes an internal investigation. They expect me to go buy another dress out of pocket, and wait for them to get I don't know what from the courier, when the proof of delivery clearly states that it was signed by a different person.

3368	ratboa	Nicoleta Hancu	CHEAP FABRIC :(I ordered the Magnolia dress a week ago. It was a gift for myself and I was very excited. But, sadly, I was very disappointed. The fabric feels very cheap, it doesn t fit right at all and it does not flatter my body. I do not understand why the price is so high given the quality of the dress. (200 eu) Also, I felt angry that I had to send proof (photos) that the dress does not fit me and to pay money again to send it back ( 36 euro ?!?) It is not a cheap dress, on the contrary, so it does not make sens. I am truly sad that I had this experience because the dresses look very beautiful on the site, but I feel that other women should know before they buy a dress. I am sorry, but I will never buy a ratandboa dress again.	2023-04-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/644d60428a16b17b6beb9eed	-0.0586344537815126	neutral	["dress", "cheap", "fabric", "fit", "send", "buy", "ordered", "magnolia", "week", "ago"]

3375	ratboa	Lucy Clegg	Sorry to be a Karen but….. I’ve always been such a huge fan of Rat & Boa. The dresses are original and beautiful and I think I have around 10 pieces from them which are amazing quality and to me worth the money. However, I think they changed suppliers a while ago and I had placed an order around £450 and sent every item back. Quality is poor and could be from ali express or boohoo. This wasn’t a one off as I recently decided I would give them another go since my previous pieces were so good! Received the dresses and the material is cheap and itchy and nothing like the pieces I have ordered in the previous years. To charge upwards of £150 for items to be so cheap is a disgrace and you honestly should save your money and buy copies from ali express.	2023-04-19	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6440efa3fc47e39d7c589863	0.22291666666666665	neutral	["pieces", "dresses", "think", "around", "quality", "money", "ali", "express", "previous", "cheap"]

You'd have to be 7ft to wear it!! Instead of offering a replacement, customer service asked for numerous pictures with a tape measure asking me to PROVE to them was too long. After 3 days of me sending the emails, videos and pictures requested I was basically told I was lying, there was no issue, and i'd have to pay to return it.

3419	ratboa	Elizabeth Baldwin	After returning a dress due to the garment being too long, as with other reviews on this side, the customer service team said that there are a mark on the dress & the tags had been removed. This is quite simply a lie - as my daughter literary tried on the dress and I checked the tags before sealing the return. I have NEVER had a company do this before.  They then send quesionnable photos showing a mark, which can only hav been done at their side once the garment had been returned, along with with terrible generic customer service response (just read the other replies on this site as an example). No doubt someone from the CS team reply with a 'generic returns policy' response which, I believe, shows the company in it's true light. I would strongly advise not buying anything from this company.

3420	ratboa	Richard Watkins	I've ordered a few dresses in the last for my partner without any problems, usually the opposite actually. Always been happy in the past with our purchases. A dress she had wanted for a year finally came back into stock in September so I bought it as a surprise Christmas present, however when she tried it on the cut on the dress is completely different to how it is advertised online. Can't upload images to make a comparison but the neckline for example is depicted as a plunging V but the dress we received pretty much has the same neckline as a T shirt. Have spent about £500 on garments from R&B to date and only ask for a refund on this one which is falsely advertised but so far in my email communications they won't even consider it. Won't be spending any more money with this company if the situation isn't resolved fairly.	2022-12-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63b5beeb4d0773066a2df66e	0.0675	neutral	["dress", "advertised", "neckline", "wont", "ive", "ordered", "dresses", "last", "partner", "without"]

A variety of the sizes sell Out quickly and rightfully so but really a let down to wait months for a special Piece only to find it does not fit like I’m used to.

Unfortunately their big issue is the information in the size guide. It’s absolutely not true to size. After the first purchase I had to get refund and to make a purchase again for smaller size -XS. My second purchase was during their sale period and unfortunately one of the dresses even size XS was huge for me. I sent an email to ask if I can exchange the item with smaller size, explaining that the size is not accurate. Unfortunately I have been told that they don’t offer exchange policy anymore and I have to refund and order again, which means that if I want to buy this dress again need to pay £80 more.

3453	ratboa	Mrs G	I ordered my first Rat and Boa dress earlier this year and loved it!I’ve just ordered two more, one I’m keeping and one that I returned on Monday, and have just had my money refunded today (Wednesday!) - you can’t fault the customer service!I notice there are quite a few negative comments regards the material/quality of the garments, personally I think the photos online are accurate, if the description says semi sheer and you can make out the models underwear and n1pples, then that’s what you’re going to get! You pay for the cut and the fit of these dresses, some are slightly daring and risqué but to be fair if you study the website photos properly it shouldn’t be a shock when they’re delivered.	2022-09-28	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/633432421c24523f3ca074b7	0.18525641025641024	neutral	["ordered", "one", "photos", "first", "rat", "boa", "dress", "earlier", "year", "loved"]
3454	ratboa	Lily	I usually never make reviews even if I am dissatisfied with service but I thought it was important to warn others about Rat & Boa. Trust the other bad reviews on here it's no wonder they don't have reviews section on their website. First of all the fabric is extremely cheap & overpriced, I bought a skirt for 179$ and it ripped the same day. It is unwearable now, I tried reaching out and sent them photos and they dismissed me, did not offer a replacement and said "their factories go through extreme testing" basically putting the blame on me. I find it hard to believe with all the "extreme testing" they go through in their factories, they did not notice how poor and unwearable the fabric is. They are overcharging people and they know it. I got such a bad vibe from this company, they definitely are scamming people.  They don't care about providing high quality garments or good costumer service. I would suggest spend your money elsewhere. There are a lot of other stores you can buy from that are also very cute & HIGH QUALITY like Reformation or Andrea Iyamah.	2022-09-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/632c6cd3e619801c6a5f0d11	0.013333333333333338	neutral	["reviews", "service", "bad", "dont", "fabric", "unwearable", "factories", "extreme", "testing", "people"]

3458	ratboa	Caroline Guthrie-Tate	I'd previously written a glowing review about Rat + Boa and couldn't wait for another occasion to come up to get something from the brand. My first time I ordered the Primrose dress - gorgeous fabric, LINED and excellent customer service.I'm now returning my second (and last) order - the Lucille dress. It's unbelievably transparent fabric with no lining, feels very cheap and synthetic. Fine if that's your thing but it's more expensive than the previous dress I ordered and considerably worse quality. They even charge £4 to make a return. My constructive criticism is to perhaps align photography and descriptions better to the product so you know what you're going to receive. These two items were worlds apart.	2022-09-15	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6322f0846a3e1ed2c3d3604b	0.17166666666666666	neutral	["dress", "ordered", "fabric", "previously", "written", "glowing", "review", "rat", "boa", "couldnt"]

3460	ratboa	Sarah Hockley	Terrible customer service and shocking quality. I first ordered a dress in March 2022 and I saw how awful the quality of the fabric was. It did not fit at all and was cheaply made. The dresses arrived unhemmed (presumably because people are different heights) which is not mentioned when you purchase so I would have had to organise a seamstress to finish the dress. I returned the item and none of the other dresses I liked were available so I requested a gift voucher. The entire summer went by and still none of the dresses I liked had been restocked. I finally selected a back up option in August 2022 which again was badly made and did not fit. When I requested a refund they have completely refused to give me one. Appalling. Do not recommend using this company.UPDATE: the hem was left unhemmed which I have been advised is standard practice for Rat and Boa so I am not sure why in their response they are not aware of this!! Very bizarre!!I had to wait 6 months for any of the dresses to be restocked. Almost all the nice styles were out of stock in the Spring and were not restocked. So if you are purchasing think very carefully about spending that amount of money on very poorly made product that you need to spend extra on to finish and if you want to return it you will be offered a gift voucher than you may not be able to use for many months.	2022-09-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63209c957f7a8621ee5a89fc	-0.05242456896551722	neutral	["dresses", "made", "restocked", "quality", "dress", "2022", "fit", "unhemmed", "finish", "none"]
3461	ratboa	Janet	My first purchase ran into a bit of hiccup. I ordered from the US site assuming that the products would ship from the US (i.e., US distributor) as I also paid in USD. I live in Mexico, so I'm very careful to only order products from the US due to high customs/import fees. They shipped the dresses the following day - so quick response time! However, when I found out that the dresses were coming in from the UK, I quickly reached R&B to cancel and/or recall the order as my import fees would be astronomical. When I reached customer service, they were super helpful - and I'm incredibly thankful as other companies would have probably given me the shoulder. They refunded me and recalled the package. I couldn't have asked for better support. I have since placed another order (this time to a US address) and looking forward to receiving the dresses and hopefully they arrive in time, as I have a wedding in a few days.  Five stars. My only constructive feedback would be to modify all the shipping 'FAQs' to clearly state that all products are shipped from the UK to allow non-EU/US/UK/AU customers to make better and informed decisions.	2022-09-05	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/631f69e36a3e1ed2c3d0dd4f	0.17939393939393938	neutral	["would", "products", "order", "dresses", "time", "fees", "shipped", "reached", "better", "first"]

3476	ratboa	Kirby Pollard	Awful experience! Ordered a bikini top from Rat and Boa, which their courier DHL lost in the post. It took a great deal of time for Rat and Boa customer services to come back to me.They then shipped me out a replacement (I had to push for this). The replacement arrived, damaged. I emailed Rat and Boa to state that the item arrived damaged and had to chase for a response. I chased again, noting that I would be out of the country for some time. They replied to my email asking for pictures which had duly been provided. Customer service emailed me back stating they would refund me. They then apologised and said this email was sent in error. They asked me to return the damaged item even though I had clearly noted that I am overseas and do not have access to the item.At no point when I stated that I would be overseas and asked them to ADVISE ME ACCORDINGLY. Did they request or note that they item may need to be returned.I have asked for contact details to speak with Rat and Boa but they will not provide these.** UPDATE ** I have tried to reach a resolve on this with Rat and Boa. It is almost like they don’t want me to return the item. I have chased and chased for confirmation on how I can return the item - for them to state the necessary documentation is attached when it is not. They have asked my mum to go into my property while I am away to dig out the damaged item (that they sent, that I have provided photographic proof of) in order to return it. Not great customer service given the first order didn’t even show up. I arrange for my mum to visit my property in order to return the item and they haven’t even sent me the return label they state I am supposed to have. They state it is attached to an email when it is it. They don’t proof read their emails and I have been messed around endlessly. I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time and the second but now I am incredibly unhappy at the service I have received.	2022-08-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62f3bbc58000af4a885a5225	-0.017307692307692305	neutral	["item", "return", "rat", "boa", "damaged", "state", "asked", "time", "customer", "chased"]

I have never spent this much on a dress but when it arrived I loved it. The fit and colour and material was all great. Unfortunately throughout the day I noticed the fabric was starting to pull, it happened once which I thought would be fixable but by the end of the day there was lots of little pulls and snags. I sent a message a few days ago but haven’t heard anything back yet, it said someone would come back in 24 hours.	2022-08-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62ed6dab8000af4a8856005d	0.15765625	neutral	["dress", "ago", "day", "would", "back", "bought", "week", "wedding", "high", "hopes"]

3480	ratboa	Char Ballard	I bought the Zephyr blouse less than a month ago and only wore it once, for 2 hours. After taking the blouse out to wear again, I noticed laddering across the back panel of the top, which appeared to look like a material flaw, originating from the seams. I then emailed the company to ask for assistance with the issue, I would have even been happy with recommendations on how to repair the item, in the name of sustainability. However, they have admitted themselves that this item is irreparable, whilst also inferring that I was lying about how the damage was causedThe fact that this issue could occur, after only two hours of wear, demonstrates the lack of quality that other reviewers have mentioned. For a brand that claims that they are “sustainable”, the garments are not made to last. Having worked in the head offices of luxury fashion brands, this should not happen to high quality and “sustainable” garments, that are designed to last.  This is greenwashing.	2022-07-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62deadcc4c35e69ec51944d9	0.11683333333333332	neutral	["blouse", "hours", "wear", "issue", "item", "quality", "sustainable", "garments", "last", "bought"]

However, its been 5 days and I havent gotten any feedback.I am in a rush with this matter because I am due to travel and will be out of the country for 2 weeks, and I dont want to be missing the return/exchange deadline and then having to keep a dress that doesnt fit me.I have emailed customer service yesterday but havent gotten a reply. Usually companies dont take more than 24h to provide return/exchange details.Please be advised that if you purchase from here and want to return/exchange an item, the process is slow and inflexible.Status update: After having to go to instagram and comment on their post i finally received the attention and information needed and I managed to exchange the parcel. I have received the new item with the updated size and I really liked. Customer service could be improved and more attention could be given to instagram messages to avoid people having to go and comment on their posts.	2022-07-21	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d927eb8000af4a8846880e	0.09702797202797202	neutral	["want", "received", "returnexchange", "exchange", "dress", "size", "email", "havent", "gotten", "dont"]
3482	ratboa	Ghita Tadlaoui	I ordered a Cecelia dress for a friend’s wedding. I wore it less than 4 hours when the right shoulder strap broke and a friend of mine saved the situation by knotting it (otherwise I was going back home to change). I wrote to the customer service explaining the situation and they kindly offered an exchange, or a refund after sending back the dress. I wrote back and chose the refund option and I informed them that I shortened the dress to wear it for my friend’s wedding in case they were going to put it back in stock.Rat and Boa’s customer service used my honesty against me to avoid any replacement or refund proposition. They wrote back to me that as the dress has been altered, they won’t offer anything and that the return policy mentions returning the dress in its original state (with the label!!)As I explained the dress is obviously not it’s original state, because it has been worn and the label has been removed. I kindly pointed out what I deemed to be a malfunction: it’s not normal for a dress that expensive and sold by a brand that promote sustainability, to break the very first time it’s worn. It’s not normal for a brand to be dishonest and consider that a necessary alteration (I assume that not all Rat and Boa customers are models that can wear the dress without shortening it, and reading other comments in this section, I found the customer service answer about the length of dresses “Many of our items are created with extra length, but with the intention that they can be adjusted easily for our petite customers.” 7 dec 2021) far far away from the strap area could be the origin of the malfunction. I highly considered this brand and was waiting for a special occasion to order my first Rat and Boa dress, now I am afraid with my experience and reading other comments that this brand is another fast fashion brand that is using green washing and pretty pictures to sell expensive and poor-quality items.Just a quick update : the customer service ended-up offering a 20% refund but I am still cautious about the manufacturing and won't recommand the brand as they don't have any satisfying after-sales policy	2022-07-20	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d7c5ac8000af4a88455e88	0.0739810924369748	neutral	["dress", "brand", "back", "customer", "service", "refund", "friend", "wrote", "boa", "wedding"]

3485	ratboa	Mari	Bad quality bikinis. Ridiculous sizing! I ordered a size L bikini as I am as size 10/12 and the bikini that came looks like a children’s bikini. Not enough fabric to cover my breasts. Quality feels very cheap especially considering the expensive price tag. I will never been ordered again and encourage women with bigger breasts to not trust this shop.

3492	ratboa	Sophie Pettifer	AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Cheap quality, impossible to clean.I bought the Anastasia dress as an investment piece to wear to multiple abroad and UK weddings this summer in a bid to be more sustainable. When the dress arrived I was shocked to find it was 100% polyester and Made in China. Already not quite the ethical choice I was hoping for. I wore it to one wedding where a few drinks splashes naturally were made on it. 4 days later when I was in the UK I arranged for dry cleaning, cool iron only per the label instructions. Not a mark shifted. Rat & Boa are not only refusing to take any responsibility for their poor quality, impossible to maintain item but have the audacity to blame me for not SOAKING the item right away (??) when their own instructions clearly state DRY CLEAN ONLY. Do not bother wasting your money on this shambles of a company, their products are poor quality and you'll end up barely being able to wear it.	2022-06-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62b456dcba5bb6ef0420f292	0.011904761904761906	neutral	["quality", "impossible", "dress", "wear", "made", "dry", "instructions", "poor", "item", "avoid"]

I contacted the courier and I saw the photo proof of postage wasn't even my house! I've been trying to resolve this both with DHL and Rat & Boa and neither have been helpful. I've been given misinformation all along the way, constantly being told that they're attempting to retrieve my parcel but it's been 2 weeks and still nothing. Rat & Boa are refusing to refund me even though it's the courier error as they want to wait 28 days(!) for an investigation. Absolutely appalling that they put the customer at a disadvantage for a courier's mistake. I'm now down £190 with no dress to wear for a wedding and big surprise it's out of stock. Again.

3504	ratboa	Sim Dhillon	I ordered an item, and had to exchange it. In the time between the exchange being shipped out, I moved homes. So DHL ships it out to the original address, and I request an address change- which is approved. Except DHL still delivers it to the old address. The worst part is, Rat and Boa's customer service made me wait an entire month for the DHL investigation to be completed just to tell me that they will not be refunding me for my missing item or sending me an exchange. Normally when a company has missing packages, they will send a replacement pretty immediately while the shipping partner investigates. But not Rat and Boa... after waiting for a month, I'm told I'm out of $200?!

3521	ratboa	Gisele	I had been eyeing Rat & Boa for a few months now but their sizes always sell out and the prices are far too high but I am so grateful that they offer and allow Afterpay on their Aus site(I live in NZ) I bought the "Valentina" because of Kylie Jenner and the "Fiorella" dress. I couldn't be more happier with my purchase the only negative was I wish the "Fiorella" came in silk especially for such a high price but I guess its very expensive to dye such a pattern with all the colours on silk but omg is it gorgeous.As I was waiting for my order to arrive, a few days later I got an email saying that there would be a up to 70% off sale!! Just as I paid full price for two dresses. But I waited until midnight for the sale and bought the "Gisele"(because my name is Gisele) and the "Fabienne"(because Kim Kardashian wore it). I am so happy and pleased with my experience. Any negatives is that their sizes always sell out fast so if you want something on their site, and your size is in stock, buy it. I did put my email in to get notified for the "Cypress" shirt and skirt, I just happened to check both the items and my size was available but I never got emailed, then when I tried to buy it, it sold out lol I guess because it was a return? Maybe the notification system should be refined more better?I have made two purchases from their UK site and they have been delivered crazy fast, wow(I am so happy that ClearPay is also AfterPay, so if an item is on stock on their UK site and not their AUS site I can make installments) very happy about that. I would say it takes 4 to 5 business days from the UK to NZ. I have made a few purchases from the Australian site and it has taken well over a week, but the courier service they use for their AUS orders are experiencing delays due to covid and weather but nothing too bad.	2022-03-08	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6226a83a361b35c36d603837	0.12521943573667713	neutral	["site", "aus", "happy", "sizes", "always", "sell", "high", "afterpay", "bought", "fiorella"]

I won’t buy from them anymore because the price is to expensive for what you get. I live in Canada and if I want to put a dress I can’t because it’s so see trough and it’s -10 here.

3526	ratboa	Anna	Bought a size M dress, which the sizing guide on the website informed would fit a size 10 UK. When it arrived  it was way too small, barely closing. I am a size 10 UK in all brands. Requested an exchange for a size XL, received an e-mail from Rat and Boa informing me this would be no problem, returned the item and waited. Mind you, I really wanted the dress, therefore would be willing to buy another item instead of exchanging. However, once returned size M was received at Rat and Boa, I received an e-mail informing me that size XL was not available. Checked on website, size L was also not available. Of course, if you are selling so fast, why even bother with customer satisfaction right? Clowns.	2022-02-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/620b9852bc5a51af69c2e858	0.08174603174603175	neutral	["size", "would", "received", "dress", "website", "email", "rat", "boa", "informing", "returned"]
3527	ratboa	Cliente	It's been 5 years since I bought my first Rat&Boa dress, Cerretti, my favourite one (and I have the blue version too!). Now, I own quite a few of their dresses. They are cut out for women; I'm an XS and they just fit like a glove. The colours, textures...I love all of them. 5 years ago, the dresses were short; I'm petite, so now I have to make some arrangements :-), but it's worth it.PD: I like Cerreti is not avaiable now! It feels like having a treasure.

3534	ratboa	customer	I ordered the Cypress Skirt and shirt and received it within 2 days which was amazing. However, upon opening my package I found the shirt to be scrunched into the plastic packing. So it was obviously returned, which isn't an issue however the way it was repackaged was very disappointing. Because it was scrunched into the plastic, the shirt arrived extremely creased. This kind of makes you question the level of care they place on products, especially considering the high price point. As for the quality of the product, it is pretty mediocre and does not match the price.	2022-01-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/61e11a76a16c1e751f68c226	0.022777777777777786	neutral	["shirt", "however", "scrunched", "plastic", "price", "ordered", "cypress", "skirt", "received", "within"]

3544	ratboa	Nia Je	I really like the concept of this brand and the designs. The price point is also not bad. Customer service is very efficient as it should be. The reason I gave it two stars is that the XXS is still quite large on me. I am a small person in stature, but not tiny. I’m 5’3 and 106 lbs, very toned body. On two different occasions I’ve purchased dresses and both times I had to return. The first one was so long that even 6 inch heels could not make it work. Also, it was too large in the shoulders. The second time I realized that the length for each dress is actually shown, so scanned one by one each dress to find the shortest one at 129cm. It was still very long, but also big in the body area. The proportions seem to be made for tall people only as the slit on the XXS hit in both dresses at an awkward point. The torso part was also very long for something that’s a size XXS and made me look so frumpy as the whole dress just didn’t sit correctly. So all in all, this brand caters primarily to taller people.Also, this second time I actually looked at the label and realized this company works out of China, which is a big no-no for me. Wish it would be mandatory for companies to state in each product’s description where it was made, so we don’t have to waste time and money.	2021-12-07	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/61af636b0b7cbbcbfe03dbdf	0.04160714285714285	neutral	["also", "one", "xxs", "long", "time", "dress", "made", "brand", "point", "two"]

3552	ratboa	Chloe Lauren	Rat&Boa make some truly beautiful pieces, although pricey I’ll still continue to buy as they frequently have sales and a great membership programme if you’re a frequent buyer. The only reasons for 4 stars is that so many of the items are sheer so sometimes I don’t feel comfortable wearing them out. The price point can be quite high considering viscose is the most used fabric, some pieces seem quite fragile on the seams because the fabric, although slinky on the skin and falls well, feels thin. It would also be great to see more women of different shapes and sizes. Valentina is beautiful but the expectations for it to look anywhere near as amazing on me at home is very low!	2021-11-20	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6198cee58931a3308731159e	0.30842105263157893	positive	["beautiful", "pieces", "although", "great", "quite", "fabric", "ratboa", "make", "truly", "pricey"]

3572	ratboa	Alia A	I absolutely love this brand and their designs. They’re are always classy and elegant as well as sexy and make me feel super confident. However, I have ordered many pieces over the years and have noticed a slight change in quality of the garments. The silk dresses I have purchased have always been amazing and fit beautifully; however, many of the more recent designs are made of rayon, which, I’ll add, isn’t reflected in the price of the garment. While I adore the design, my recent purchase of the Karina dress was disappointing. On the model it looked flowy and elegant, but when I received it it was a lot thicker than expected and didn’t fit well as the material was quite stiff. I have  also had a few problems with the payment/website when I try to buy the items. Although these are soon resolved by the customer service team, the faults in the website can be quite stressful. I will continue to purchase items from rat and boa, but hope some of the recent issues can be resolved	2021-10-07	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/615f8208d12ab8ef5160bbca	0.24556277056277062	neutral	["recent", "designs", "always", "elegant", "well", "however", "many", "fit", "purchase", "quite"]

The prices don't make sense and it's very hard to figure out what I will get! Also need to check your print placements more, I know it can't be too specific as it wouldn't be cost-effective but the first Casablanca I got was dreadful placement as it was extremely unflattering, since it's a sheer dress the placement is SUPER important. I also think every time I want something it's sold-out especially my size which is extremely frustrating. Can't complain much about the sale as it was a sale and I expected it to go fast. I love the editorial-like photos but when I go to the product page Its not helpful to see the model all contorted in poses with weird lighting -  I would love to see it on a model of different colors and sizes so I can actually figure out what I will receive. Also web navigation menu could really use some work I mean I have to go through so many filters just to find what I want - I don't care what collection it was released in or if its animal print or whatever - I want to be able to shop long dresses, short dresses, tops, pants; instead in order to shop I have to filter through my size which is also not helpful.	2021-10-07	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/615f0069d12ab8ef51604001	0.13079044117647062	neutral	["also", "love", "dress", "want", "need", "specific", "soft", "casablanca", "dont", "figure"]

3587	ratboa	Alice	2021I am a loyal customer and have been buying from this brand for years, even before it was really famous. The dresses are wonderful, the shipping service is fast and the customer support is kind. But I give 3 stars because maybe they should just stop doing sales. I think I only managed to buy something on sale 3 years ago. Today it happened again. Many things were already sold out before the sales started and today I entered the site at the exact minute of the start and there were 3/4 of clothes left in stock. So.. what’s the point ? Make the sales when the goods are really there, make the sales when a customer is able to shop for at least 10 minutes. Otherwise it's just a mockery.update: September 2022Really good job rat & boa!you have been corrected and this time everything worked fine! the sales lived up to expectations.thanks for working on it	2021-09-26	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6150689d215cfcced27083f6	0.35744047619047625	positive	["sales", "customer", "years", "really", "today", "make", "2021i", "loyal", "buying", "brand"]

3589	ratboa	Izabelle	I had a horrible experience with this brand. A pair of pants I had bought from them ripped the very first time I used them. I did not do anything besides simply wear them, the length and size being perfect. Therefore I wrote an email explaining this, expecting to be met with understanding that this should not happen. I was arrogantly refused, as well as accused of the fault being my own. I did not recieve any apology, refund, new pair pr anything of this nature. Due to the prices I expected quality, which the one who responder to my email also claimed that their brand stands for. This brand scammed me, provides terrible service and terrible quality - do not buy anything from them, you will regret it!	2021-09-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/614cf1ae215cfcced26e921f	-0.11636363636363636	negative	["brand", "anything", "pair", "email", "quality", "terrible", "horrible", "experience", "pants", "bought"]

One of the belt loops came off after wearing it twice, and the skirt front crinkles after you’ve been sat for a while, leaving some long streaks that ruin the dress’s look.

Even though the v neckline does drop low, I felt well covered and nothing a bit of tape wouldn’t fix. I have since purchased the Valetta dress - oh my god everything was hanging out!!! It drops so widely that if you have a slight bit of boob (I’m a C) they’re out on show. You can slightly alter the straps, however once you get to the beading they won’t go up any higher. I’m going to take it to be altered further (I love the colour and beading) and hoping I can make it a bit classier.	2021-08-30	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/612d1999cc0087e8ef696160	0.09545454545454547	neutral	["bit", "dress", "beading", "previously", "owned", "isabella", "favourite", "wardrobe", "fit", "phenomenal"]

3606	ratboa	Eleeza	TLDR: The company's size chart / tool makes no sense -- disregard it and get your normal size. If you are curvy/have an hourglass shape and want their ball gowns to be tight everywhere, forget about it. Materials are not stretchy/more for a straight body or you can wear it as a column dress, I guess.For context, I wear a size 4 (sometimes 6) and jeans size 26/27 and my cup size is 32DDD. Using their 'figure out your size' tool on their site it told me to get an S or M, depending on whether I typed in 4 or 6 as my size. Fair enough, makes sense!However, when I checked the size chart (the table which maps measurements in inches or cm to size) it indicated that even L would be too small for my measurements. Being extremely confused, I went with the middle size, size M in the "Athena" dress.Alas, it's too large. It's a little bit too large on my bust and hips and way (!) too large on my waist. I'm not going to bother sizing down because it's pretty clear that that size also won't hug my curves--it would fit my chest and hips but not be tight on the waist and not at all look like it would in the pictures. The reason I'm disappointed by the fit is because for the most part the ball gowns fit the models very tightly/hug their bodies. If you have a more hourglass figure the ball gowns will not do that for you as they have no stretch and are not cut for hourglass bodies.	2021-08-21	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6120983f150e959f0f1d1a95	0.09761078042328042	neutral	["size", "hourglass", "ball", "gowns", "would", "large", "fit", "chart", "tool", "makes"]

3620	ratboa	Ramona A	I was never so disappointed with an online purchase. So, I loved the designs but the quality of the fabric is just horrendous, especially for this price tag. You simply cannot ask this price when you offer such poor quality, products are Made in China( I wasn’t aware of this until I received my parcel) … fabrics are just terrible and the stitching is coming out.. the marketing pics are perfect but you do not get what you see on Instagram. I really hope you will do something about this.. and stop what you’re doing right now because it’s just wrong. Not to mention that returns aren’t free. Hopefully in the future you will use high quality fabrics ! Until then you lost me as a client.	2021-07-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/61027cf0f9f48709d4c228f5	0.025714285714285703	neutral	["quality", "price", "fabrics", "never", "disappointed", "online", "purchase", "loved", "designs", "fabric"]

3624	ratboa	Julia Goncharova	Interesting costumer service. While I was exchanging, someone was in touch with me few times a day. When it came to return, costumer service disappeared. I am not even getting emails from them with the confirmation that the company will reply in 24-48 hours. Am I blocked from the email. It’s been 5 days. I ordered three different dresses in two shippings. One of them I wanted to keep but was too big, so I submitted the exchange and received the exchange label same day but I change my mind the same day and decided to return. I reached out to costumer service the same day but they told me they can’t control the system(does the system control you?). So I tried to submit the return on website but it did not let me. I just attached the receipt with written instructions inside the return package and still received exchange instead of the refund. From second shipment, when I ordered two dresses, I decided to keep one and exchange another one. Also, the respond was very prompt and no issues. I received the exchange and the dress still does not fit me. So out of tree dressing I am still keeping one and have been trying to return two and have been planning to order in the future. At this point I am so dissatisfied and disappointed with the company. Please reach out to me I want my $400 back. This not the way to make costumers wear your dresses. Especially, when this can be resolved via PayPal but I hope I won’t have to go that road.	2021-07-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60ed7cc0f9f487075040fcfa	-0.03214285714285715	neutral	["return", "exchange", "day", "one", "costumer", "service", "dresses", "two", "received", "still"]

3631	ratboa	OSQ	So disappointed. I went into it aware that a lot of the dresses are designed to be see-through, so I made sure to check when I bought two lovely looking silk ones, that this wasn't the case. They arrived and are terrible. The fabric is unbelievably cheap and nasty, absolutely not worth £200+, the cut is strangely long and weirdly shaped. I was disappointed but thought oh well I will return it, it must be free returns given I just spent nearly £550 on two dresses- BUT NO. The payment for the return comes out of your refund AND you have to do it via DHL which is a genuine nightmare. Free AND EASY returns should be the norm. Let us take it to a post office if you are going to create shoddy clothes. The only upside is that their customer service replies relatively quickly. That is literally the only positive thing I can say.UPDATE: Having seen the reply (franky another example of lovely customer service just bad product), in order to get to Black Tier you have to buy products, which doesn't help because the products are bad and you don't want to keep them. You can see what I am driving at here.	2021-06-04	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60ba31e8f9f4870a94b616e8	-0.06625874125874126	neutral	["disappointed", "dresses", "two", "lovely", "return", "free", "returns", "customer", "service", "bad"]

3655	ratboa	H Kaur	I’ve had a few dresses from Rat & Boa (was hopeful the quality would improve!) and whilst I love the designs and they are definitely different, the quality of the materials used are absolutely shocking for the price you pay!! Much like the other negative reviews - there seems to be a common theme. Terrible quality of material, see through and definitely not what you would expect for the price you pay. Also the items can’t even be washed (even as advised) without falling apart, colours running into each other and shrinking. I don’t doubt there are other people who have had these issues and it doesn’t surprise me they were able to do a flash sale of more than 50% discount(some up to 70%) on their dresses as they obviously make a very large margin on the dresses because of the material they use! It’s such a shame as the designs are great but unfortunately the quality just isn’t there. And unless you’re in a position to spend £165 -£200+ on a dress you’re going to wear once before it falls apart then you won’t be shopping here! Please please sort out the quality of the material!	2021-04-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/607dea3df9f48704b8f854a6	-0.060949248120300774	neutral	["quality", "dresses", "material", "would", "designs", "definitely", "price", "pay", "even", "apart"]

3660	ratboa	Angie Ko	I purchased a dress for which I followed their size guidance. The dress came way too large. It also came with two runs in the dress, one very large one on the back. I’ve contacted the company via messenger, Instagram and Email to no avail. Apparently I can send the dress back for the cost of $36 but why should I have to pay for a defective dress and of such inferior quality. Not happy at all. Wish someone would please contact me before I have to go through other avenues.

3666	ratboa	Natasha	I first noticed Rat & Boa on instagram a year ago. I eventually bought the Ferreira Dress and Roberta Blazer and trouser suit during a 30% promotion this year. The dress is lovely but as it is transparent I need to add an extra layer underneath. I was a little disappointed with the how the material felt and the stitching but loved the print so decided to keep it. The trouser legs of the Roberta suit are extremely wide so I'm hoping I pull off the outfit! I also bought the Fabienne and Fiorella dresses at full price. Fabienne was way too long and the stitching slightly off and Fiorella had a faulty zip and slightly shoddy stitching so I returned both dresses. The customer service I received during the returns process was great. Recommendations would be to improve the packaging, it cheapens the brand and inadequate for dresses costing in the region of £200. Please stay clear of plastic bags. Improvement on fabrics and stitching to match the brand image and price point would be good. I was surprised and disappointed with the quality of the Fiorella dress as the print is stunning and something I would have worn.	2021-04-03	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60688e49f85d75087046626f	0.0982843137254902	neutral	["stitching", "dress", "fiorella", "dresses", "would", "year", "bought", "roberta", "trouser", "suit"]

3668	ratboa	Kate Marriott	What happened to the quality at rat and boa ? A couple of years ago I bought a beautiful cream all in one which I adore. Recently I bought a white suit which looked amazing on Instagram. However when it arrived it was awful. The quality was terrible - cheap, see through fabric. More like ASOS on a bad day than the luxe materials they claim to use. Upside was that return was easy and efficient. Such a shame they are now using such cheap materials.	2021-03-31	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60641e4ef85d7508703f4ca1	0.03717948717948721	neutral	["quality", "bought", "cheap", "materials", "happened", "rat", "boa", "couple", "years", "ago"]
3669	ratboa	OH	I ordered three dresses from Rat and Boa during a sale but was disappointed with the quality for that price when they arrived.

I didn't receive a prepaid return label but went down to the local post office and sent it myself. I had a few questions and the customer service team always replied super quickly over email.

3672	ratboa	Carolina	Very few dresses are ok (not for the price tag!), several are definitely a NO. The main concern is quality. The dresses are mostly a see through and for modeling pictures on Instagram, great! But for the majority of all of us to wear it on our event needs, definitely a big no. Paying this price, you want something ready to wear. Also, the quality of the fabric is very suspicious, specially because they do not add the fabric composition tag on their dresses! If you are used to high quality fabrics will immediately tell the quality is not in there. Some they say “silky” is definitely just pure a polyester 30 dollar dress and they charge you 250 dollars. I would love to love them, because the design is actually nice, but I am returning them all.	2021-03-27	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/605f5421f85d75087038b635	0.28543417366946783	neutral	["quality", "dresses", "definitely", "price", "tag", "wear", "fabric", "love", "several", "main"]
3673	ratboa	f andrews	So disappointed with this company. I bought a matching jacket and trousers set from them over a month ago. The trousers were see through and a different material to the jacket so didn’t look like a matching set. The jacket was covered in stains and dirt marks! I contacted the company to exchange the jacket and return the trousers but they had no other jackets in stock, so I suggested a partial refund for the faulty jacket. It has been weeks of chasing this company and being ignored until I post on their Instagram which they quickly delete. They have closed my case with PayPal without refunding the correct amount and continue to pretend they don’t understand the amount they are supposed to refund, despite agreeing to it in writing! Horrendous customer service and very quick to delete any comments asking for a reply on their social media yet don’t reply to emails.	2021-03-26	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/605d29a9f85d750870357ca8	-0.014062499999999992	neutral	["jacket", "company", "trousers", "matching", "set", "refund", "delete", "amount", "reply", "disappointed"]

I love the dresses received but I have to admit that I probably won't be able to wear most of them outside the house; they are just too transparent and you would need to invest (in addition to the pricier dress) in good shape / no-lines-underwear to wear them out. Most of the dresses seem tailored with slim, perfect bodies in mind but nonetheless they are stunning.Will most likely order again but focus on the lined options.	2021-03-10	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6048b330f85d750394263606	0.4055555555555555	positive	["dresses", "wear", "ordered", "multiple", "times", "rat", "boa", "delivery", "always", "super"]

I also feel the the pricing of the clothing can reviewed too. They are reasonable don’t get me wrong, but for example i feel like the Stevie dress is the same quality and style as the Isabelle dress but yet more expensive? Just little tweaks!

3714	ratboa	Romana Hrvatin	I live in the NL and bought the Roberta trousers and blazer, because I loved the look when I saw the pictures on Valentina. But, as I am far from supermodel size, I had to send the blazer back because it just looked like a lot of fabric on me with the wide pants and draping and bow on the blazer. Made me look huge! I would love to see the items on models that are not a size xxs... Everything just looks like its made for super tall skinny models and not meant for regular girls like me. The pants are also waaaayyy too long so I'll have to cut them. BUT I love the fabric, it is made beautifully, I love the R&B style and both delivery and return to the UK was within 24 hours. Refund also came immediately, so on a customer service note, I have no complaints at all :) Once I find another item that looks like it would work for an average size, I would definitely purchase again.	2021-01-20	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60084d4c755dc104c0c385fe	0.2313131313131313	neutral	["like", "blazer", "size", "made", "would", "love", "look", "fabric", "pants", "models"]

I have never in my life been so frustrated and disappointed by an online order. i ordered 3 dresses full of excitement to see them and wear them. So! 1. Quality is the cheapest, worst, roughest quality I have felt on a dress in my entire existence. Do not recommend  to anyone honestly the worst worst quality. 2. Does not look Anything like marketing image. So basically the dresses appear so beautiful and elegant but they are cheap!!! 3. Wayyy overpriced. Each dress costs approx 150£ - Honestly i wouldnt give more than 20 for it !!!!! The worst worst experience of my life with a brand. Oh And LET ME TELL U THE WORST PART; I went into their insta to comment and they deleted my comment, blocked me . So then I asked 10 friends of mine to comment a negative review so i could see if this happens all the time. And YES... they deleted All their comments and blocked them.

3738	bbxbrand	Preeti Sanghera	I placed an order with BBXBrand in April 2025 and paid extra for express delivery. The item arrived four days later than expected. Unfortunately, I was not satisfied with the quality of the product and decided to return it.I requested return approval on 29 April and received it on 30 April, which was a UK bank holiday. Due to being away and the limited availability of postal services, I returned the item via tracked Royal Mail Next Day Delivery on 7 May. The item was delivered to the company on 8 May in unused condition with all original packaging.Despite this, the company refused to issue a refund, stating the return fell outside their 7-day policy. Their policy does not clarify whether this refers to calendar or business days and does not appear to account for bank holidays or weekends. I raised my concerns, referenced UK consumer laws (including the right to cancel and return goods within 14 days for online purchases), and offered to resolve the issue through alternative dispute resolution. I received no response.I also discovered that the company listed on their website, BBXBRAND LIMITED, was dissolved in 2021, which raised concerns about the legal entity currently trading.I have since had to escalate the matter through Klarna and my credit card provider to recover the funds. This review is to share my experience so others can make informed decisions.	2025-07-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/686bec04082f014f75826474	-0.018367346938775512	neutral	["return", "april", "item", "days", "company", "bbxbrand", "delivery", "received", "bank", "limited"]
3739	bbxbrand	Linda Hudson	I had been waiting for a particular dress to come back in stock, I emailed customer service about the dress and they informed me they had no plans to restock the size I wanted and advised me to buy it in another size or colour, I opted for one size bigger as I really love the style of the dress, mind you its not cheap at £225! Two days later the dress came back in stock!! I emailed customer service lady called Amina back and she advised me to buy the size and return the other one for a refund in case it sells out again! They don't offer exchanges so I tried to do a refund but there was no option on their returns portal for a refund as I had used a discount code, which they provided!! I am still within the 14 day window but customer service have stopped replying to my emails, now I'm stuck with a dress and cannot get a refund which I am legally entitled to! I have researched them on Companies House (registration number 12643861) and they were issued a final gazette notice and have been struck off companies house, effectively dissolving the business, so they are trading illegally.	2025-06-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/685a693e365dbcd8533de81d	0.04019431089743589	neutral	["dress", "size", "refund", "back", "customer", "service", "stock", "emailed", "advised", "buy"]

3740	bbxbrand	Yemurai	I ordered a dress, it arrived on time, but due to personal reasons I was not able to return it within the 14 day window. I spoke to a customer service agent that advised that as a good will gesture they can accept a return within 21 days for store credit. I asked to begin the process, as i have no need for the dress, it's completely unworn with tags and labels. However, I was then informed that i had gone past the 21 day period as well, which makes no sense. UK law clearly states that the return window begins from the day that the goods are received (how are you legally able to count the return window before goods are received? I can't start returning something I don't have yet).I would have happily accepted a lesser refund since I was outside of the legislated 14 day window (not the non compliant company window).I do not fault the agent I spoke to, the companies policies are not right, especially if they are going to be trading internationally.Very disappointed.	2025-04-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67fcfb1e958a8895c884d65d	0.04872448979591837	neutral	["return", "day", "window", "dress", "able", "within", "spoke", "agent", "goods", "received"]
3741	bbxbrand	Carolina	I have never felt so compelled to leave a negative review, but my experience with BBXBRAND has been so poor, I believe it's important to share it with others.I purchased two items from BBXBRAND, and both arrived damaged. I followed their return process and sent both items back promptly. However, since then, I have had to chase the company repeatedly for any updates on my refund. Despite multiple attempts to reach them, I have yet to receive any meaningful response or resolution.BBXBRAND has failed to meet its legal obligations under UK consumer protection laws, specifically the Consumer Rights Act 2015. This legislation entitles me to a full refund for faulty goods, yet BBXBRAND continues to avoid fulfilling this obligation, leaving me out of pocket.Their on/off responses and complete disregard for customer satisfaction are deeply concerning. The lack of transparency and accountability in handling customer complaints is nothing short of unprofessional.I strongly urge anyone considering purchasing from BBXBRAND to think twice. If you encounter any issues with your order, expect a frustrating and time-consuming battle to get any resolution. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this company.At this stage, I am left with no choice but to pursue further action to recover my refund, as BBXBRAND continues to ignore its obligations under UK law.Update: After posting this review, I would expect BBXBRAND to take action immediately, but given their track record, I remain doubtful.	2025-04-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67f6b0a64b0bf476d58378b9	-0.011403508771929825	neutral	["bbxbrand", "refund", "review", "experience", "items", "yet", "obligations", "consumer", "continues", "customer"]

3743	bbxbrand	melek	I returned an item within the legal timeframe and was issued store credit instead of a refund, despite my rights under the Consumer Contracts Regulations. This was over a 10% discount code, and I still kept one dress, as I was weighing my options for my birthday—so I had still spent a respectable amount with them.When I raised this, I was met with misleading claims and accusations. Fortunately, my bank refunded me, but the process was unnecessarily difficult. A brand aiming to project a luxury aesthetic should prioritize customer trust over short-term profits. Be cautious if you ever need to return something.	2025-02-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67adfbc1f48b4fe3d05fd790	0.1	neutral	["still", "returned", "item", "within", "legal", "timeframe", "issued", "store", "credit", "instead"]

3751	bbxbrand	Pene	Unfair practises and don’t care about customers. God awful customer service and the owner is just as rude as the staff. Ordered a dress for a wedding and missed the fact it was a pre-order dress because it’s written right at the bottom of the dress description section which is just stupid. Have they never heard of banners, stickers or labels? Anyway cancelled the order a few days later before the order had even been processed and was told I couldn’t get a refund because I had used a discount code. They would only give me a store credit which I insisted I didn’t want because I won’t be shopping here again. Only to be ignored. I also found out recently that the store credit only lasts 6 months lol so I’ve tried to make another order so I don’t lose my money but my order has been cancelled for whatever reason I don’t know.	2024-10-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6743a91ce3e472811308989e	-0.14285714285714285	negative	["order", "dress", "cancelled", "store", "credit", "unfair", "practises", "care", "customers", "god"]
3752	bbxbrand	Marianne	I ordered a dress from this company all the way from the US. I reached out regarding receiving a return label as the items quality was not as expected at all and the customer service rep informed me that 1. return labels are not provided and 2. I was trying to return the item 2 days before the 14 day return window closed. Mind you… Return shipping is around $30 from the US back to the UK which is a percentage of what I paid for the dress and I LIVE IN THE US. The norm is an 30day window for returns, so their policy is absolutely rubbish. So, I filed a claim with my bank, informing them of these details and letting them know that the item was “damaged or not as described”, the only option they provided that made sense, which in this case was the latter. As a result, I was issued a refund as a chargeback. However, I received an email from their customer service rep Am**a this morning, accusing me of lying and telling the bank that that my item was damaged and she proceeded to threaten me, stating that they’d be turning me into local fraud agencies to, “protect other small businesses”, which is laughable. Screen shots are readily available from our email correspondence and my bank.I’m completely appalled by this company. Especially given the fact that the quality of their items are PISS POOR. If I wanted thin, mesh dresses, I’d shop at SHEIN. I do not take lightly to threats and do not appreciate a small business with a struggling brand, customer service team, and reputation sending me snarky and threatening emails. No class, much like the quality of their clothing. I was very excited to shop with this brand, but clearly there’s still much development to be done within this business.Please be advised that you never know who your customers are or what they’re capable of. Besides, according to social media reviews, your practices are troubling to many outside of myself and your customer service team is notoriously unprofessional. I may add my own reviews on social media as well, but I will also gladly follow this up in court.Now waiting for another rude email response from their silly rep and their weak attempt at a professional response to this review. In response to BBXbrands response below: all the details provided here are the same as the details provided via email and you know this. Playing dumb is fitting but please don’t play coy. The quality of this piece is so bad, I’m considering dropping it at my local goodwill. I would’ve willingly provided the same feedback to your customer service rep. However, your customer service rep did not request or make inquiry into why I was seeking out a return. Instead, they simply notified me that the return window was closing in two days and that even if I sent my return, it wouldn’t get there in time to be refunded. Which in my opinion is a shady business practice for an international customer, nor is a reason for return required under your policy. Even the item being free would be too expensive. Again, the lack of accountability, professionalism, and tact is telling.	2024-11-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/673f3e8f3a8a672c5e05e6da	-0.01521043771043771	neutral	["return", "customer", "service", "rep", "provided", "quality", "item", "email", "response", "window"]
3753	bbxbrand	Lateipha	In my years of receiving customer service this company has delivered the worst I’ve ever received.Still in shock but I must say, order with faith and pray nothing goes wrong from whilst your order is being processed through to delivery.Ordered a Sheer black dress that came with a small tear which would likely be an accident during packaging. The material of the dress is very delicate.I emailed the company and sent photos they requested.The company inform me that they have checked CCTV and QR information and this black dress was sent without scratches.They were 100% sure of this I asked for evidence of this information.I infact reassured them that I loved the dress and would prefer an exchange.They took no accountability and was willing to argue back and forth to assure me that an exchange or return will not be accepted.The person behind customer service is argumentative and perhaps need a course to be taken on management & customer service.No proof or evidence was provided and in fact they didn’t respond to my email.I’m in shock and hope that they will see this review and take action with their customer service delivery.I rate -5!Terrible	2024-10-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/671f843c4f2a0d195ca4a52a	-0.0523809523809524	neutral	["customer", "dress", "service", "company", "shock", "order", "black", "would", "sent", "evidence"]

3760	bbxbrand	Bobbie Nicholson	Do not buy from this company. BBX Brand do a great job of marketing and advertising their products, thats a fact. But their dresses are far from worth the money you pay for them. When I received my dress it smelt horrible, the sizing was awful, the material is cheap, the stitching is awful and it was just a crazy experience from start to now. As an ONLINE retailer, UK consumer law overwrites their policies as they are an online retailer, if there is an issue with their products, especially when they are not as advertised. I sent back 2 dresses which were of awful quality and not as described and they are refusing (going against the LAW) to refund me. Sent me a voucher i’ll never ever use the whole while i’m breathing! They love to argue their case in email exchanges, with their sarcastic tone.. and even go to lengths of calling you by a different name and putting kisses at the end of their emails… sooooo sarcastic lol!Their customer service skills are far from professional, and whoever is advising them on their policies clearly hasn’t done their research on UK law.  Please make sure, if you do purchase, to use Paypal or Klarna to cover you. As the grief you get from these uneducated individuals is actually tiresome and boring and very repetitive. No doubt some one will comment with a very sarcastic reply on here (queue the drumroll). I’m just spreading awareness. Do your research first, but I highly discourage anyone from buying from this awful brand. Luckily I posted this to social media and managed to save a friend from working with them for their marketing and sales side and also save girls from eyeing up their website. They really are awful.	2024-07-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66aa9934028fc06d168e26a5	-0.14901041666666667	negative	["awful", "law", "sarcastic", "brand", "marketing", "products", "dresses", "far", "online", "retailer"]
3761	bbxbrand	Chloe Jade	Ive had a terrible experience with this company when ordering a dress for my baby shower. There was only a size 12 available, while I usually wear a size 10. I contacted customer service to ask about the lead time and if I could return the dress if it was too big. Knowing exactly which dress I was interested in, they assured me it was returnable. Based on this, I placed the order, thinking I could exchange it for a different size or get my money back if needed.A few days later, I became concerned after reading reviews on Trustpilot and emailed the company again to confirm their return policy. They then told me the dress was a pre-order item and non-returnable because it was made to order. This made no sense since I couldn't even order a size 10 in the first place. If it were truly made to order, I should have been able to choose any size.I requested to cancel the order, as it had not yet shipped, but was told I could only get store credit and no refund. When I asked about exchanging the dress, they said I would need to buy another dress and would only get store credit for the original dress, effectively costing me double the price.In their last email to me on Monday, they told me I needed to let them know what I wanted to do as the dress was due to ship that day. I replied in a couple of hours to say I will have to keep the dress as clearly I have no other option without being out of pocket. I have received no response and it is now Friday, clearly the dress was never ready to ship. This entire experience has been incredibly frustrating and upsetting and now I’m getting no response from them.Do not buy from this company.

3763	bbxbrand	Bridget M	Finally took the plunge to order my 30th bday dress from here after deliberating for months. Unfortunately the dress was awful - the sizing and fit is just off! And the dress looked nothing like the image; if felt much cheaper quality than pictured or priced. I decided to return it immediately to get my refund but to my surprise they don’t offer refunds on any items bought with a discount code (codes which they send to your inbox as a subscriber to the store). This is not only unfair on a customer but also against the consumer rights acts legislation for online purchase. From speaking with the Trading Standards, this has been escalated to be resolved however it’s a shame a brand would put so many loopholes to keep customer funds. A reputable brand would have no issue just issuing refunds - unless you anticipate a lot of complaints 😊The one pro is how responsive the customer service team are to come back to queries. I don’t bought if I wanted to exchange my dress they would be able to assist. Unfortunately the quality has put me right off and now stuck in back and forth with them to get my refund back, as legislation permits.	2024-05-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66638f60ec2ecdf76c39cb79	-0.0009523809523809564	neutral	["dress", "customer", "would", "back", "unfortunately", "quality", "get", "refund", "refunds", "bought"]

3775	bbxbrand	Fayobi fadojutimi	They are one of the only retail establishments that do not give refunds for sale items.  They claim to only give credit notes for sale items that are returned, yet, it’s been over a week that I returned 2 items and the full price has been refunded but I am still waiting for the credit note.  This is a credit note that was not issued in due time for their new drop of stock ( their stuff sells out almost immediately) I spent over £300 on their new drop and was told that I can not off set my credit note that is pending, although they understood my point, so only God knows how I will ever spend a credit note since there is never any stock available.  I have had 3 emails stating they are looking into my refund, yet still no resolution, please stay away from this brand, there is no customer service no and they dnt care about their customers , they just want to take money.	2022-05-04	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62729072166eb7ecbf3cddbb	0.08863636363636364	neutral	["credit", "note", "items", "give", "sale", "returned", "yet", "still", "new", "drop"]

3804	wanderdoll	IL	Ordered the Yris dress in white. It came and was see-through, as well as having a very odd extra bit of material on the shoulder which looked like a badly manufactured hiccup. I then received a gift card from them when I returned it, despite choosing “refund back to original payment method” when creating the return. I contacted them, and was told that “FC” on the product name meant final call which means no refund given, only gift card. They expect their customers to know that the abbreviation meant that. I asked them to show in my account original order email confirmation, where it says that it was final call, and they weren’t able to show this to me, just keep highlighting the “FC” on their website. I’m not sure why I ordered from them, as I’ve ordered a total of 3 times now and have always had to return due to poor manufacturing or material. It is convenient that a dress which shows your full seamless underwear, is under “FC” meaning customers will never be reimbursed. Their customer service advisor was also very patronising and rude in his last email; he could not show me the terms and conditions in my screenshot I sent of my original email, but kept advising me I “clearly” agreed to this by checking out.	2025-06-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/683dbe9a5271c207824de780	0.01742424242424243	neutral	["ordered", "original", "show", "email", "dress", "material", "gift", "card", "refund", "return"]

3814	wanderdoll	Customer	I bought the ARIA Maxi Dress in a size 12. It went on easily but was impossible to take off without help. The poor construction means the dress can’t be removed without placing it under stress. I wasn’t wearing makeup, tan, or body products, and filmed the struggle to remove it.Wander Doll refused my return, citing “marks” on the satin — but the photos they provided show normal creases and folds, not product transfer or damage. Satin is known to mark easily under pressure, and the fabric used offers no tolerance for standard trying-on.The size 12 is also labelled “large” but fits more like a 10. I’m a true 12 and rarely have sizing issues.Trying something on to assess fit is a legal right. If a dress becomes unsellable from being tried on once, it’s not fit for purpose. I’ve escalated this with Klarna and Trading Standards and would advise others to be cautious before buying.	2025-05-22	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/682efa7a58e669ea35dcbd7b	0.14	neutral	["dress", "size", "easily", "without", "satin", "fit", "bought", "aria", "maxi", "went"]

He immediately offered me a replacement, I just had to return my item and show the proof of postage and a new one was shipped to me with next day delivery (the wedding was in a matter of days so I made some requests i.e. not having to wait for them to receive the dress before shipping my replacement, and for it to be sent next day), and Gary was super helpful in making this possible! He also personally checked my replacement item before shipping, to check it was perfect!

3822	wanderdoll	Emilee Durkin	If I could put a 0 star I would. Usually have no issues with Wanderdoll and love their clothes. I’ve ordered a dress for a party I have later on this month. Tried it on and realised it was too small, sent it back to be accused of washing and wearing the garment and refusing a refund by someone called Gary. I took pictures of me trying it on with time stamps and it went back in the bag and was returned. This dress was a special treat for me as it isn’t cheap so to be told I’m not being refunded was ridiculous. I’ve asked for it to be escalated and no one has got back to me. No telephone number to ring either to discuss this I am appalled by their service.	2025-05-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681f0f3924f6765c7cc2fa5e	-0.0341991341991342	neutral	["back", "dress", "could", "put", "star", "would", "usually", "issues", "wanderdoll", "love"]

3864	wanderdoll	Muhiim Mahamud	I recently attempted to return the Ainsleigh Bardot Rose Maxi Dress I purchased, but I have had a terrible experience with this company. When I received the dress, it did not have the tags or ribbons attached, which I assumed was an oversight during the packing process. The dress was also too big for me, so I never wore it.However, when I tried to return it, I was informed that they couldn't accept the return because the item was missing its tags and ribbons. This is extremely frustrating, especially because those items were never included with the dress in the first place. It's clear to me that they are using the return policy as a way to avoid issuing refunds.I find this to be a dishonest practice and feel cheated by the company's refusal to process a return, despite the fact that the dress was in unworn condition. The dress was an expensive purchase, and the company is clearly using unfair tactics to keep money while providing no resolution for the customer.I would not recommend this company to anyone.

3867	wanderdoll	Kath	Bought item, worn once for a few hours, washed as per instructions on the label. Been told I must not have done so, which has really upset me as the company have insinuated I’ve lied without even properly inspecting or testing the product. I always follow correct instructions and never had any problems. It’s rude and not treating customers fairly. So frustrating when you follow the instructions on the label. Liaised with trading standards who have advised at the bare minimum they should have offered to test the item with the manufacturers or out of good will offer refund as this should not happen if you follow the instructions. This is a fault of the company and poor quality clothing. From the many bad reviews I’ve seen over various sites and forums, I can see this is a reoccurring problem with scamming decent people. I will be taking this further. The Customer service team need better training on how to handle these situations.	2025-03-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67d489b4e75fc744d6ce6f42	0.008333333333333344	neutral	["instructions", "follow", "item", "label", "company", "bought", "worn", "hours", "washed", "per"]

3870	wanderdoll	Alex	Do not order from this company who are trading illegally.  I reported a return for my order which they received 2.5 weeks after I had taken delivery of the items.  This was during the Christmas and New Year period and took 4 days to get there via Royal Mail (their chosen delivery partner).  They are refusing to refund me as it is outside of their 14 day returns policy (they didn't offer any extended returns deadlines due to Christmas public holidays which says enough in itself) and will only give store credit - funny enough I don't want to order from them again.Wanderdoll really need to do their research because they don't seem to understand that the Consumer Rights Act takes precedent over their (quite frankly ridiculous) internal policy.  It is there to protect customers from companies like this and I will be reporting them to Trading Standards.	2025-01-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67c19954c8f5837766afcc35	-0.030997474747474746	neutral	["order", "trading", "delivery", "christmas", "returns", "policy", "enough", "dont", "company", "illegally"]

3875	wanderdoll	Katie	Refund scam. Extremely disappointed with this company. Believe all of the reviews and don’t purchase. They were fast becoming one of my favourites and I’ve spent lots of money with them whenever I’d have an event, they were my go to but it appears they are scamming people out of refunds. I returned 3 items on this occasion as they just weren’t right. One of them had a tag slightly ripped (my tiny little dog grabbed it as I was trying it on) it was returned because of this but to my horror Gary from customer services also added that there was a strong scent. I was mortified and my first thought was yes I would return it too! When I received the item back, there was no strong scent whatsoever and I asked multiple people. I of course challenged this and had a reply that said multiple people also said there was a strong scent and having admitted my dog had got hold of the tag I was met with the assumption that my dog must have been laying on it so they can’t accept it back for hygiene reasons- you absolutely couldn’t make this up now I’m being accused of something that didn’t happen. Surely a tag can be changed. The item is in perfect condition, absolutely no scent and the security ribbon still in tact as it was clearly unworn. Their customerservice team needs some training and I will be taking this further. I am so angry that they have made up things to not return. Had they have said it was because of the tag I could have maybe accepted but to make up that it has a strong scent and to assume I have let me dog lay on it? Needless to say I won’t be using them again and I will be sharing on social media and taking a trip to their HQ so they can all smell it in front of me and tell me what the strong scent supposedly is	2025-02-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67b4599036de711709346e81	0.0849647266313933	neutral	["scent", "strong", "tag", "dog", "people", "said", "one", "returned", "also", "return"]

3882	wanderdoll	TIA SAUNDERS	Firstly, I'd like to just say I think the clothing is very good quality and the outfits are truly gorgeous. However, the only thing I cannot get over is the sizing. I am a Size 8 and therefore would order a Small of this Website. I now own 3 items, a corset size small, a skirt size small and a knitted dress size medium. The corset and skirt is the matching denim coord... well it may as well be made for someone who is a size 4. These items are not true to size.The brown knitted dress, I chose to get this in a  Medium as clearly the sizes come up a lot smaller. this was also extremely tight and I'd say was to fit more of a size 6. it could also do with a couple of inches added to the bottom. Usually things like this wouldn't bother me, but, the sizing of this clothing has knocked my confidence massively and I'm sure others would've had the same problem. I'd say if you tend to be a size 8 or above then go 2 sizes up. I'd say this is a brand for more petite girlys.	2025-01-17	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/678a245d7cf5a2121389fe0e	0.15532142857142855	neutral	["size", "say", "small", "like", "clothing", "get", "sizing", "items", "corset", "skirt"]

3887	wanderdoll	Gia Renae	Scamming, thieving and dishonest practices.  Refusing refunds for made up reasons, “worn” but tags still attached , “pet hair” but a pet free home, and then a “strong scent” from items that were never even tried on- again all with tags on. I wish I’d seen some of these reviews beforehand. I will be chasing this up to the fullest extent and will be reporting to trading standards for denying basic consumer rights and on fraudulent grounds. Worst and most obvious case of misuse of policy I’ve ever witnessed. Will also be disputing all charges. Pathetic excuse for a company.

3888	wanderdoll	D R	If I could, I would give ZERO. Please read all the reviews, their return policy is a SCAM. First of all, my order arrived LATE. Only after chasing them for my original delivery, they said the items were out of stock at time of purchase therefore they went into back order to be shipped 2 weeks later - please note there was NO mention of this at all at time of purchase nor on the order confirmation! When asking to cancel the back order they REFUSED to do so. I should have known then that I was in for a scam! Because WHY are you confirming my order if the stock is not there? Anyway, it should be easy enough to cancel a back order, since the item was unavailable therefore not allocated yet. But they said NO.When I finally got my order (for a total of 4 items), I opened 2 (I repeat, TWO) of the packages to have an idea of the sizing and quality of the fabric. The 2 items were NOT tried on and put back into original poly bags straight away, since no longer needed (arrived late for my event, as per above!). All 4 items, 2 of which weren’t even opened AT ALL, were sent back as an approved return. I then get an email saying my return was received, but cannot be accepted and I won’t get my refund, due to ALL garments having a strong SCENT upon inspection. This is clearly an excuse, since only 2 out of 4 items were ever out of the package, in a CLEAN home, for no longer than 1 minute! When I replied saying I was offended by their statement, extremely disappointed in their service AND asked to escalate and to clarify what type of scent they were referring to, I was told by one customer service manager that they are “not specific when describing scents” (???) and that no, they won’t accept my return, as due to this scent none of the garments is in re sellable condition, despite UNWORN, with all tags and ribbons.I find this outrageous. Please unless you are 100% sure you’ll keep your order in its entirety, do not risk your money here!	2024-12-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67705727aa6cbfd1ddfaff8c	0.017857142857142856	neutral	["order", "items", "back", "return", "please", "since", "scent", "scam", "arrived", "late"]

3913	wanderdoll	Lily Byrne	*READ THE BAD REVIEWS!!!* SCAM! This website is a scam with fake good reviews, please do not purchase from here! I spent £140 on a set and paid for 3-4 working days, it's now been 2 weeks and nothing. I spoke to royal mail and they told me they haven't received anything from them. Customer service is awful, I've asked for a refund every day via email and they made an excuse and put the blame elsewhere. I have now had to contact my bank and trading standards. I will continue to trash their social media until they get this website taken down. With just having my third child I really needed this money and there are people like this out there scamming people. So I will not stop until I receive my money and their website taken down.	2024-11-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/674f15e4eaa1d904fd6b14ac	-0.16843434343434344	negative	["website", "reviews", "scam", "taken", "money", "people", "read", "bad", "fake", "good"]

3949	wanderdoll	Natasha	I recently purchased a lace bodysuit and matching skirt. It was delivered Friday afternoon, I tried the items on Friday evening after returning home from work then submitted the return the same evening- mostly down to the sizing, ordered XL and the bodysuit would barely go up my arms! I’m a size 12 for reference. The quality wasn’t the best. The lace was of poor quality, was on par with SHEIN. The bodysuit was alone was £43! I’m not the sort of person to spend this sort of money on an item such as a bodysuit but was hoping to wear it to my works Christmas party. The bodysuit had a hygiene sticker on it. There was no way you could try it on without removing the hygiene sticker. Fast forward to today, I have receive an email to say they won’t be refunding me due to removing the hygiene sticker, pet hairs on the items and a scent to it. I’m beyond shocked! I literally had the item on for about 2 minutes maximum. More shocked they’re saying there is a scent to the item and pet hair. The items were returned in perfect condition with all the tags they came with. This was my first order with Wanderdoll and it will be my last. If I do not receive a refund, I will speak to trading standards regarding this.In reply to their response. The website doesn’t state ANYTHING AT ALL about no refunds on bodysuits without hygiene stickers. And the pet hair and scent you’re talking about is non existent!!!! I received the items back yesterday and they’re in perfect condition!!! I’ve literally got the item in front of my eyes and there is nothing wrong with it! It’s like your making me out to be a lying! I think your returns team are blind. Funny thing is, you accepted the skirt back and out of the two products, if there were pet hair on anything, it would be on skirt where it’s touched the floor when trying on. You’re a bunch of scammers just trying to grab any penny you can from customers.	2024-11-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/672f21aa426e25aae9c5393a	0.02979497354497355	neutral	["bodysuit", "items", "item", "hygiene", "pet", "skirt", "sticker", "scent", "hair", "lace"]

3952	wanderdoll	Vita Siniauskaite	Customer service is on the new level of rudeness. I have received a damaged item and when I returned it they refused to refund blaming me for the damage. Funny part, they send the item back to address I don't live anymore. So if there are any problems with the item you receive, customer service will show very little interest and avoid to refund as much as they can. As they are small retailer and goods made from cheap materials, don't expect much. I will avoid this company and that is my advice for all the girls. There are plenty better quality retailers in this country. Update. I was not refunded nor I got the item they had to send me. The customer service is totally useless and clueless or just playing games. I personally think it's unethical business. Hope, that the bank and authorities will help to sort this out. By the way, I read online that plenty of girls had issues with refunds and returns. Not one, not two, but plenty...	2024-10-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/672a37860bf2e1d025b20de1	0.06908143939393939	neutral	["item", "customer", "service", "plenty", "refund", "send", "dont", "avoid", "much", "girls"]

They have ignored every single email and deleted every single comment I have left on there Instagram page. This was my first time ordering from them and will most certainly be the last. The customer service is the worst service I have ever come across, they have been so unprofessional and unhelpful.

4012	wanderdoll	lauren rose	I would have put 0 if I could have done for the disgusting customer service I have received from the company and had to fight to get a refund when their knitted two piece had become faulty within 1 day of wearing it and within 30 days of purchase. They had refused to give my money back and this went on for a month, where they wouldn’t respond to me regularly. Their reasoning for not giving me back my money, was that it had been worn? Ofcourse it had been worn that is why I purchased it. I had to result to take this to the Consumer Ombudsman, Trading Standards and contact my bank to try and get this resolved. After proceeding with my actions they have finally given me a refund today, however my emails have again been ignored and I’ve had no apology from them which goes to show how much they don’t care about their customers but more about the money. Just be aware for future reference, they are quick to take your money but when it comes to a faulty item that’s within 30 days you will struggle to get a refund. Just bare in mind, after The Consumer Law Act 2015 you are fully entitled to a full refund of the garment if it becomes faulty within 30 days and should it become faulty within 6 months you will be entitled by law for the company to exchange or for a credit note. Just so everyone is clear on their rights for this specific company, as they try not to abide by The Consumer Act law.Thankyou for your time to read this and I will never be purchasing anything from yourselves ever again, and I will be spreading the word.	2024-05-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6685262d3e3552d2f59878c6	0.05595238095238094	neutral	["within", "refund", "faulty", "money", "company", "get", "days", "consumer", "become", "back"]

4021	wanderdoll	R Ashley	How this company hasn't been investigated by Trading Standards is beyond me.I've finally got my refund after nearly six weeks of hassle and arguing with this company. I returned several items as I thought the quality was pretty poor given the price they're charging (the quality really is no better than what you'd get on Boohoo). These were returned in perfect condition.A couple of weeks later, one of the items was sent back to me. I thought this must have been an error as I had received no notification from the company to say they were returning an item. When I contacted Wander Doll, they told me that their returns team had found makeup on the garment and therefore could not accept the return. I explained that this was impossible as I was not wearing makeup when I tried on the clothing. What followed was me asking several times for details of where this makeup was found and photographic evidence taken by their returns team to prove this. I eventually was told that "makeup was visible on the back of the garment, the front of the garment and the bottom of the blazer at the back" and "around the bottom of the garment." In response to this, I provided a video, which showed the entire garment was in perfect condition, with no makeup marks whatsoever. Upon receiving this video, the Wander Doll team suddenly changed their tune and said they would provide a refund if I returned the item.I asked once again for the evidence from their returns team that showed the item was supposedly covered in makeup. I was told that "an error has been made by our returns team who did not take photographic evidence which is our policy to do so". Convenient. I have read several other reviews on Trustpilot and Google identifying pretty much the exact same scenario - either people being told their item had makeup marks or a 'scent' and therefore could not be returned, so seems this is a scam they try on a regular basis. Unless you want to lose money and spend several weeks arguing with an incompetent and frankly quite rude customer service team, I'd suggest avoiding this company at all costs.	2024-04-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/665b028b5e9827f904ba9fc0	0.03685897435897435	neutral	["makeup", "team", "garment", "company", "returned", "several", "told", "returns", "weeks", "back"]

4026	wanderdoll	lucy Dolman	Avoid this company !!!Ordered 2 sizes in a top and trousers set tried on the top and it didn’t fit same evening ordered the size I needed .Sent the items which didn’t fit back 4 days after receiving due to going away on my hen do .Took them 2 weeks to send an email notification about a refund and then only part refund just the trousers not the top I only Received this email because I chased my refund the night before ! As it arrived the day after I returned back to them on Royal Mail tracking ! I emailed to find out why only part refund when I literally tried it on and realised it wouldn’t fit so didn’t even get the zip all the way on . To be told they was marks on the inside lining of set top which was a corset ! They sent photos and the photos you can barely see any marks to the point i questioned how do I know they wasn’t already on the top as who checks in that much detail the inside lining of a top ! They still refused to refund me even though that mark could of been on this prior to be receiving customer service very dismissive couldn’t answer my questions why it took so long to let me know and why I had to chase even for a part refund ! They like to with hold your money and will clearly do anything to get out refunding people on top of that the refund now takes an extra 10 days for just the trousers ! All tags and ribbon was attached and they could tell I hadn’t worn the item ! How do I know someone hasn’t made these marks in their warehouse with it being back there 2 weeks !!!! Before emailing me to say they had received it will be seeking legal advice on this as I think this is disgusting behaviour and very unfair when I clearly haven’t worn the item and I had no tan or make up on as had actually been for my first wedding dress fitting the day I tried it on top of the fact I kept the sizes which fit me and I wore ! Would not buy from them again and iv warned all my friends about how bad this experience was even they couldn’t see the marks they was trying to show on the photos they sent !	2024-05-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6644ca02361c811134ff00fa	0.1382142857142857	neutral	["top", "refund", "fit", "even", "marks", "trousers", "tried", "sent", "back", "part"]

I didn’t even do up the zip when I tried it on. I sent both items back for a refund. I had an email from the items saying company saying my return was received on the 29/4, and only today they emailed me saying they have only refunded me for one item, saying I removed a label on the other one and are sending it back to me. They attached a photo; which didn’t show any label removed, and I know there wasn’t one removed when I I sent it, because I tried it on for less than 10 seconds. Disgusting customer service, as I returned both items in the mail exact condition they arrived in. You can’t buy from this company as you cannot guarantee you will get a refund for any returns, even if they weren’t even tried on and in perfect condition.

I absolutely loved it!! I originally ordered the dress in a size below mine just to be sure of quality etc whilst I was waiting for my size to come in and even though it didn't fit and had to go back I still would not hesitate to order again, in fact its the first dress of 12 (across various sites) that I've ordered and actually really been happy with. I emailed the customer service asking if they knew when it would be restocked and got a quick and helpful response from Lilly. Eagerly waiting for my size to come back in stock so I can re-order.	2024-05-06	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6638c050a9033e7b6ceee899	0.38166666666666665	positive	["dress", "ordered", "size", "quick", "beautiful", "quality", "waiting", "come", "back", "would"]

I only come to open it this week March 2024 as I finally have an occasion I can wear it for only to open the parcel and there was only a skirt in there and not the top that I ordered aswell (a co ord ). I emailed them to ask where the top was and I understand that it is 3 months later but it is their issue that they never put the top in the parcel only to receive an email from them saying “there’s nothing we can do about this, the outfit comes as a set so it was packaged together” well it weren’t and now they refuse to either refund me and I send the outfit back or send me the top out.	2024-03-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65eaf4a3f21c92ba96883406	0.14285714285714285	neutral	["outfit", "top", "ordered", "finally", "never", "wear", "put", "open", "parcel", "send"]
4071	wanderdoll	Ellie	Would give this company a 0* review if I could! Absolutely appalling. I have been liaising with a ‘Phoebe’ who works at ‘Wanderdoll’.I received an email on 28/02/2024 which stated that one of my items that I had returned would not be refunded as it’s not in the same condition it arrived in - they sent a photo which evidenced no mark on the photo and sent the co-ord back out to me, refusing to issue me a refund! I have looked over the co-ord and there is the slightest mark which I think I’ve missed when trying the outfit on. The mark was on the bottom of the skirt and I didn’t even have it on long enough to mark it! I instantly didn’t like it. The outfit was returned unworn, with tags and they will not refund me as they are stating it’s not “resell able” which is ridiculous. So disappointed with the customer service. I will not be ordering from this company again - clearly trying to scam people out of money when reading other reviews! I am still liaising with ‘Phoebe’ who has been so unhelpful and has disregarded everything I’ve said.£96 they will have of my money for nothing! Disgusting! Be careful when ordering from this company!

4084	wanderdoll	Clx	I emailed CS after being a couple days over the (very short) return period, due to the XS items being far too long and big. 7 days later no response, emailed again. 2 days later, left a comment on IG, 3 days later another one saying I would leave a review- low and behold someone messaged me straight away to ask for my order number, gave it to them and my email, no response, messaged again, no response over 48h. I am £100 down the drain on something that was not made correctly for XS sizing.

I sent them an email chasing up my return and refund as I never got an email to say they had received the return and would start the process. Which was like a game of Cluedo. They then claimed they didn’t receive my parcel back, when I had clear proof with an image they had. Took about 1 month from sending back my parcel to eventually receiving my refund. Be warned they are not forthcoming on sending your money back to you anytime soon. Communication was absolutely terrible. Never answered questions or queries I had. Eventually got a refund after contacting PayPal.	2023-12-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6570dddc09126c6e301e5f8d	-0.14444444444444446	negative	["back", "parcel", "sent", "refund", "order", "received", "email", "return", "never", "got"]

Well…the dress arrived on 2nd Dec and OMG it is absolutely beautiful. Fit perfectly, great quality and looks exactly like the image (you ladies know how many times you buy a dress and it’s nothing like the picture 😣). I’ll definitely purchase from here again…I’m delighted! The size guidance on the website was super handy. I go between 2 sizes and the website said to go the smaller size as the dress has stretch, they were bang on with this advice.

4145	wanderdoll	AliciaPBx	The customer service from this brand is second to non. I ordered a set for my nieces birthday in the summer sale, it was months before her birthday and unfortunately when I gave her the set the top didn’t fit. She was gutted and there were no more sizes left on the website, I emailed customer services on the off chance they happened to have the size we needed in the warehouse just not on the website. Luckily they did and allowed me to swap the sizes even though I had originally bought the wrong size months prior. The new top fits my niece perfectly she loves it and I’m so grateful for the amazing customer service.

Not only did the team (a lovely lady named Lacie) contact me the next day to let me know they had changed it, she also messaged me on Instagram late at night to stop me worrying. The best customer service ever, I was so grateful! Also my pjs hve now arrived and I can’t wait to wear them tonight!

Firstly the delivery was super fast I had it in my hand in 2 days and where I stay it normally takes much longer.  The bikini was a stunning colour and good quality.  I put it on and couldn't believe I felt unreal In it the fit was so perfect.  I always really struggle to find a good bikini that ticks all the boxes but now I have found the PERFECT one .  It super supportive aswell . I have had 2 kids and never thought I'd feel so confident in a bikini again am actually in love .  I really hope they get more colours in as I NEED them all . The frills are super flattering and cute cant say enough about it.  I also love that the top and bottom are sold separate as I need 8 for top and 10 of bottom . Definitely get one we all need them in our lifes.

4164	oddmuselondon	Rezuan Mohammed	I never write reviews ever, but i felt the need to do so this time. Their returns fees are a joke! I bought a dress for £165 and had to pay £5 for shipping, then when it arrived it didn’t look as it did on the website, the sizing was too big and it had a few stains (if it wasn’t for this the quality of the dress would've been decent). Naturally I had to return it only to figure out £5 would be deducted from my return as a returns fee, on top of that I had to pay around £5 for a royal mail return label. So i’ve now spent £15 just on delivery and returns which is a joke! Other places give free delivery if you spend over a certain amount and their returns are free too. I’d think twice before ordering from here it’s not worth it at all, absolute robbery.	2025-07-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68717b8a297569aa16ebf013	0.10622710622710624	neutral	["returns", "return", "joke", "dress", "pay", "delivery", "free", "never", "write", "reviews"]

4171	oddmuselondon	EML	It looks like their customer experience team has been replaced by AI and it’s unfortunate to have an issue and not have a human (with emotions such as empathy) to interact with. There is no flexibility with their AI returns, even though their dispatch error is the issue and they wouldn’t offer a 1 day extension on a return for a (very loyal) customer, shipping from the other side of the world. As always, their product is great but their customer experience is not.	2025-07-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/686e11b9bda2ca1d70f02f69	0.1013888888888889	neutral	["customer", "experience", "issue", "looks", "like", "team", "replaced", "unfortunate", "human", "emotions"]
4172	oddmuselondon	Amy MacLean-Peden	Returned an order on 26th May 2025 (via Royal Mail tracked) as per Odd Muse policy. No acknowledgment of the return received, despite tracking noting delivery. Contact made via the ‘ChatBot’ service & email customer service. FINALLY received acknowledgement of return today (8th of July) so, 6 weeks later. Because of their delay, I have late charges via Klarna which they are unable to resolve. This has to be the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I even contacted the owner for assistance, no response. Appalling. Avoid at ALL costs.	2025-07-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/686cff4bbd56a00049264f1f	-0.330952380952381	negative	["via", "service", "return", "received", "customer", "returned", "order", "26th", "may", "2025"]

4178	oddmuselondon	Moira Coles	Sizing is just awful. Ordered two dresses in the same size but different colours one is massive and one is tiny. The smaller one is actually so tiny - I am a 14 and I have F cup boobs and the smaller dress wouldn’t go near me. Tried it on my sister who is a 10 with A cup and it doesn’t even fit her. I’m just generally confused. Plus I got the dresses in the sale, paid £11.99 for next day delivery and then have to pay for delivery to return plus a fee. That is just ridiculous. The material looks very expensive online, it’s not. It’s Shein quality polyester 😭 I really really wanted to love this brand as I’ve followed their story on social media, but my experience has not been good!	2025-06-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68675c57b10fa7f473023e63	-0.015277777777777772	neutral	["one", "dresses", "tiny", "smaller", "cup", "plus", "delivery", "really", "sizing", "awful"]

4179	oddmuselondon	Sophie	For a company who states that they are ‘ dedicated to providing you with an exceptional shopping experience.’ I have never experienced such poor customer service. I loved the look of the dresses online so I ordered several to try at home ahead of my hen party weekend. I kept one dress and returned the remaining within the 14 day returns window. I have proof that they received the return from Royal Mail tracking 2 weeks ago, however I have not received any correspondence from Odd Muse. I have contacted the company via email multiple times and via the online chat. I received an AI email to say that my return had not been received and that the issue would be escalated ‘promptly’ to a member of the team but I am still waiting for any correspondence. The online chat states that you should receive a response within 15 minutes but I have waited all day and still nothing…Please avoid ordering online at all costs, I am owed in excess of £500 so the situation for me is becoming increasingly stressful. I wish that I had read the customer reviews before purchasing because I can sadly see that many people have had a negative experience from this company.	2025-07-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6866d44034ddffe66786488a	0.045833333333333316	neutral	["online", "received", "company", "states", "experience", "customer", "within", "day", "return", "correspondence"]
4180	oddmuselondon	Lydia	Exactly the same thing happened to me as the reviewer below! Odd Muse delivered a dress to me that was clearly worn, in a bag that was split. The dress was not heavily stained but around the neckline there were some faint marks. I returned the dress exactly how it was delivered to me (without even trying it on and all tags attached), along with other dresses that were delivered to me in immaculate condition and returned in immaculate condition. I've never been refused a return in my life as I'm incredibly careful not to wear make-up etc. when trying on clothing. The fact that they want me to pay for their careless handling of a dress is preposterous and given the reviewer earlier today had the same experience, makes me think that maybe it's something they've started doing recently!They have also refused to get back to me via email or chat as soon as I state my order number (even though they are online on the chat!).This is nothing to do with their returns policy - I read the terms very carefully and held up my end of the bargain.I'm getting married soon and was planning on purchasing multiple dresses from Odd Muse in the lead up to the different bridal events but I will never purchase from them again.	2025-07-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68667442a4a1c4ac78f70259	-0.04101851851851852	neutral	["dress", "delivered", "exactly", "reviewer", "odd", "muse", "returned", "even", "trying", "dresses"]
4181	oddmuselondon	ROBYN	I had an absolutely terrible experience with this company. The dresses are overpriced with cheap construction. One of them was fine, but the other had a side zip which sat absolutely revoltingly on the body. Unfortunately, my return was refused because they revealed that they had found period blood when inspecting the return! Disgusting, obviously, but WORSE still is the fact that I cannot medically have periods so it was not mine! Naturally they didn't believe me, so their awful customer services rep ignored my emails. I had to chase up for WEEKS to get responses, and even then, they repeated the same message practically word for word. They did not listen to me at all, and when I expressed how disappointed I was, they were completely stoned faced. It's such a shame because I told everyone to shop there for my wedding coming up and since this debacle, have obviously told friends and family to avoid them.I understand the stain issue, but CLEARLY it had not been checked properly before coming to me and then someone noticed it after the return. I do not have much money at the moment, hence choosing a cheaper option from some online store I saw on Pinterest, but this is the last time I'll ever be ordering like that again.Additionally, as mentioned, the customer service was a disgrace, but there was no phone number to have talked this out on the phone. That's extremely odd and should have raised alarms before I ordered anything anyway.Truly the worst brand experience I've had for ages. I understand the dirty return policy, and repeating it to me in three emails across a month was frankly stupid. DO NOT SHOP WITH THEM.EDIT: yeah. The reply is what I got told several times, to the point that they just were not acknowledging what I was saying. I read the policy, I understood the policy. Do not shop with this brand.	2025-04-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6866248cec28f21991abdfec	-0.22884615384615378	negative	["return", "told", "shop", "policy", "absolutely", "experience", "obviously", "customer", "emails", "word"]

The Ultimate Muse Halter Top - for a simple halter this is extremely well fitting. The zip on the side is concealed giving the top a flawless finish. Perfect paired with skirt/suit trousers or even jeans. 3. The Ultimate Muse Cap - can’t go wrong with a cap really. Lovely colour/material and size.

You can really tell they’re high-end pieces.I had some initial concerns about returns after reading a few reviews, but I’m happy to say my experience was smooth.

I am usually a 10, sometimes a 12 and then sometimes an 8 so it’s very varying but I had to keep the L for the skirt and order a XL in the top!

Green Washing 2) Really poor customer experience and money grabbing. £3 "shipping protection" automatically added on to your basket (very small so you miss it on mobile and are essentially made to pay it) and then £10 to return items???

I've received countless compliments, and it's clear this piece stands out from the crowd. It's rare to find a product that excels so remarkably in both form and function, but this absolutely does.

4243	oddmuselondon	Tamsyn Robertson	The quality and feel of the products are second to none. Really really impressed. I find the fit difficult to get right, I have to size up. Normally I am a 12 but have found I am an XL(14) in trousers and an XXL(16) in tops. My figure is very much an hourglass, so have wider hips and larger (although not massive) ‘girls’. Once the sizing is right, the products feel amazing.Only other thing I have found is that, in finding the right size, I have had to exchange the products a few times. This process is long, too long in my opinion. It is 10 working days from receipt of the returned item. Always on day 10, never sooner in my experience. On one occasion I was going to an event, purchased my dress 3 weeks in advance, by the time it had arrived, tried it on, sent it back and got the next size up my event had passed! So I sent it back. I spoke with customer service to see if I could change the exchange to a refund when I realised the dress wasn’t going to be sent out in time. Unfortunately they were unable to accommodate this. Ultimately I believe not being able to make manual interventions has cost Odd Muse as a business to send out the product and myself as a customer the postage to return. Efficiencies can be achieved here.Other than sizing and exchanges, I absolutely love Odd Muse. I will carry on purchasing as live the styles and feel.

I have purchased items from Odd Muse in their London store, the staff could not have been more helpful. I have 10 Odd Muse pieces and not one disappointed! My current favourite piece is the ultimate muse volume polka dot skirt mini dress. I will be wearing it in the French Riviera in August! Odd muse is a quality and ethical brand who works extremely closely with their factory, unlike other fast fashion brands. This is a big reason as to why I shop here. I am an odd muse girly through and through and always will be!

4281	oddmuselondon	Lea Wanders	I bought the Ultimate Muse High Waist Square Neck midi dress in-store for my civil wedding. I was promised a brand-new packaged item, but the dress I received had makeup stains, a pulled thread, and a visibly uneven cut.I returned it immediately. It arrived at their warehouse on April 24th, yet they failed to process it within the 10-working-day return window that ended May 8th — a policy they themselves set. Had they followed it, they could have sent me a replacement in time. They knew the urgency and my May 12th wedding date, but no one followed up.I flagged in my April 26th email that the receipt even listed the wrong item (mini instead of midi), and this was only acknowledged weeks later. Instead of giving me a monetary refund as the wedding day has long passed, I was issued a gift card... and now I am still waiting for my full monetary refund in line with UK consumer law.Odd Muse caused me the most stress leading up to my wedding — and I had to scramble for a new dress last minute. I absolutely would not recommend them for any wedding or special occasion. Beautiful branding doesn’t make up for poor quality control and customer service that fails when it matters most.	2025-04-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6851311da4bce62538af3663	0.050194805194805195	neutral	["wedding", "dress", "muse", "midi", "item", "april", "may", "followed", "instead", "monetary"]

4286	oddmuselondon	Margret	I have ordered three times. I really do enjoy the clothes but it took me a while to figure out the sizes. I usually buy clothes in the size XL but in Odd muse my size is 3XL and even then the tops are a bit too tight over my breasts. I was thinking of returning some items but figured it would be both a waste of time and money because of the return policy, shipping that I had to pay out of pocket and then the return fee (which I think is absurd). I also don’t like that taxes and import fees are to be paid by the costumer. When I buy from high end brands and even some more affordable brands they have it included in the price so that no hidden fee is added on when the package is delivered. I have also emailed and inquired about restocking and availability but I never got any useful responses. I asked if they could tell me if a dress would be restocked before July because I was interested in buying it for my graduation. In the answer I got (in the beginning of June) they told me that there was no set date for the restock and that they were really sorry for the inconvenience, so I ordered another dress from them. Two days later the dress that I wanted had been restocked………. That said, shopping on the Odd muse website is more of a headache than excitement and pleasure. Would not recommend buying from them online and I don’t think I will be doing it again. However the clothes are nice so I would potentially go to the store and buy from them there if I am ever in London or NY. That way I can see what fits and not worrying about not being able to return a expensive dress that does not fit.	2025-06-11	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6850733210904b1b9f05ddbf	0.03157142857142857	neutral	["would", "dress", "clothes", "buy", "return", "ordered", "really", "size", "odd", "muse"]

4304	oddmuselondon	Michelle Carbo	I love this brand so much. My only suggestion to improve is to think about a secondary store in London as it takes +40min to try on a dress on weekends. It’s mental and during summer it gets extremely hot, so perhaps some AC will contribute to have the best shopping experience!

I love the brand to bits and they are my set place to go whenever I’m in London. Costumer service is always great and quick. Hope to continue to by for al one time.

The dresses I own make you feel so good as soon as you put them on. I get excited every time a new collection is announced just to see the new pieces. Each piece you can dress up or down which is so vital and helps not to buy too many clothes as you can rewear these pieces over and over and they don’t age!	2025-06-02	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68501f5d6d9edc2bd94eb561	0.35003885003885	positive	["pieces", "new", "statement", "last", "lifetime", "honestly", "happy", "purchases", "odd", "muse"]
4321	oddmuselondon	Luchia Thomas	I love the clothing and design, but the sizing is so inconsistent it’s made me not want to buy again. I’m between a size 10 and 12 but a bust size DD so fitting in your clothes is a lottery. In one dress I ordered I was a L which fit, a little big but workable, I ordered the same dress in medium to see if it was better which was longer (skirt was longer, sleeves were longer) than the L and I couldn’t even get the zip close to me.I ordered three of your tops for work in a Large (as the dress in a L was more on the big side but fit) and I can barely get the zip closed. It’s completely inconsistent and expensive which is crazy.	2025-06-16	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684fdcb7a0ebf325395bda1e	0.1110491071428571	neutral	["dress", "ordered", "longer", "inconsistent", "size", "fit", "big", "get", "zip", "love"]

4308	oddmuselondon	Lara	I’m really disappointed by my experience with Odd Muse. I purchased a top from their London store in early April, only to discover it had visible stains when I got home. I was assured in store that any marks would come out with washing and that they would give me a discount — they didn’t.I reached out to customer service on 7th April, and after weeks of delays, back-and-forth emails, and having to repeatedly explain the issue, over 2 months later I am still left without a resolution . Most recently, I’ve been met with complete silence despite following up.I had purchased the top as part of a matching set for a special event, which has now come and gone. I have spent a significant amount of time and energy trying to resolve this, and have been left without a wearable item and out of pocket.As a loyal customer who went out of my way to visit their physical store while travelling, I genuinely expected better service and accountability from the brand.Would not recommend based on this experience.Update after Odd muse's reply: I have been attempting to contact you since the aforementioned date through multiple channels, including all your social media platforms and email. To date, the only response I have received has been via email, and even that has typically taken approximately two weeks. After nearly 3 months, the matter remains unresolved, which I find extremely disappointing and unacceptable.	2025-04-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68501e01524f01a4a8fb9f6a	0.0327175697865353	neutral	["store", "odd", "purchased", "top", "april", "would", "come", "customer", "service", "weeks"]

The quality of the clothing is absolutely unmatched—every piece feels thoughtfully designed, beautifully tailored, and built to last. You can feel the difference the moment you put it on.What I love most is how timeless and chic everything is. These are not just trendy pieces you wear once and forget. Odd Muse creates staples that elevate your wardrobe and make you feel confident and put together every time you wear them.Customer service has also been a dream—responsive, kind, and clearly passionate about their customers and brand.

4313	oddmuselondon	Sophie	Really love this brand!! Some of the sizing is a bit inconsistent, but maybe it's just my body as I'm in-between sizes ( Small and Medium) ..My Measurements, which are Medium according to OM size chart:35in bust26in waist37in hipsHeight 5'4"The Ultimate Halter Top - Size M and true to size, fits very well. The cut is very low and so my strapless bra can always been seen, annoyingly...The Ultimate Muse Shorts - Risked sizing down to a S, and so pleased I did, as the M would've been far too baggy on my waistThe Ultimate Wide Leg Trousers - Sized down again to S as M was so baggy on my waist. VERY long - had to have about 4 inches taken off!The Ultimate Muse Halter Neck Midi Dress - Sized down to S as M fit my bust well but swamped my waist and so I didn't have the desired cinched silhouette. Just about managed to fit my bust in!The Ultimate Muse Midi Skirt - Went for a S but weirdly think XS would've been better! Slightly baggy on the waist and hips so don't have the cinched look.So, if you're in-between sizes like me, or hour-glass shape, I'd recommend sizing down so that you get the cinched silhouette shape that OM do so well. The size chart indicates that I should be a M, but I've had to size down to S with most items as M was swamping me. This brand really is wonderful - lovely material and beautiful silhouettes - just make sure you get the sizing right!	2025-06-16	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68500022af4ddbdbab6666ed	0.18399833589349718	neutral	["size", "ultimate", "sizing", "well", "muse", "baggy", "waist", "cinched", "really", "brand"]

So as they said is gonna arrive in 3-5 days, 8days before the civil wedding i ordered it. I know, very risky! ( what if the size is not good, what if I don’t like it or many more, that I ignored because I always trust my feelings. I measured myself, and I knew based on the videos that I analyzed many hours, that is just gonna melt on my body. On the wedding day, it arrived 30’ before having to go there! ( because my country had a lot of paper work to do, it took a while to leave the deposit )Crazy! But I just knew is gonna arrive on time, DHL team was amazing, they replied to every message I texted them, they tried their best. In September my sister will have her wedding, and I know that I will order the same dress, different color! The maxi dress on white is a MUST!

4360	oddmuselondon	Anya	Odd Muse is hands-down my favourite brand – the quality, style, and fit of their pieces are unmatched. Everything I’ve bought feels so special. I always get compliments when I wear their pieces and love that their designs are timeless yet fresh.That said, the returns policy is really disappointing. The return window is far too short (14 days from receiving your items) and doesn't give you much flexibility if you're busy or need a little more time to try things on properly. Plus, only offering Royal Mail as a return option isn’t the most convenient – it would be great to have more flexibility with couriers or a returns portal like other premium brands.Still a loyal customer, but I do think there’s room to improve the customer experience around returns.	2025-06-11	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f495a68899bfb92127889	0.17840608465608468	neutral	["returns", "pieces", "return", "flexibility", "customer", "odd", "muse", "handsdown", "favourite", "brand"]

4367	oddmuselondon	EllenD	I love odd muse. Beautiful quality and timeless pieces. Their items aren’t for a single occasion but adaptable to a multitude of events. The only thing and this is the only thing taking away a star would be their returns policy. As a girlie who’s between sizes, it’s hard to decide on your size for an online store and get it right the first time. I wish odd muse catered better for this. Especially with high OOS I would appreciate more flexibility on this policy. This is my only criticism for a brand which is doing a very good job at making beautiful clothing I want to keep forever.	2025-06-15	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f3deba88de7ef283d715e	0.24172268907563024	neutral	["odd", "muse", "beautiful", "thing", "would", "policy", "love", "quality", "timeless", "pieces"]

4400	oddmuselondon	Maria Arnyasi	I went to the London store before going to the airport, I was waiting about 20-30 mins for the fitting room. Then I was trying on 4 dresses and chosen one of them and wanted to try an additional piece but the sales associate said I can’t try more. 4 pieces are the maximum because someone was waiting for the fitting room. I was telling her that I was waiting minimum 20 mins for the fitting room and only want to try one more item. She was not letting me to try that. Honestly I have never had such a bad experience in any store in my lifetime. Finally I bought one dress, but when I left the store I had a very bad feeling and regreted that I left my money somewhere where a SA treated me like this, however the dress is amazing.	2025-05-22	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f25b70a2f08ae221197ca	0.14928571428571433	neutral	["try", "store", "waiting", "fitting", "room", "one", "mins", "bad", "dress", "left"]

4419	oddmuselondon	Jade Foolheea	I have to say I have mixed feelings about Odd Muse. First things first I absolutely love the quality of the clothes, I have several colours of the square neck midi dresses as well as the simple statements trousers and tops. My only gripe is with the sizing as this can be a little inconsistent. There regular trousers are super long, I had to get them taken up. The dresses are not made for bigger bust girlies unfortunately. Body wise I am a 14 and the dresses fit me like a glove apart from around the bust! So I do end up having to size up on some styles as with the white collar midi I was worried I was going to pop the stitch!!! Anyway overall I really love the quality of the brand, I sometimes find that I have to get things tailored to fit my body more which can end up a bit spenny!	2025-06-05	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f1dee7804131c04c45d70	0.1501984126984127	neutral	["dresses", "first", "things", "love", "quality", "midi", "trousers", "get", "bust", "body"]

4423	oddmuselondon	Layla D	The dress was lovely but the fact you can’t iron it, particularly as it came extremely creased, is annoying. I also ordered another dress as an option for my hen do. Unfortunately after it arrived, I was unwell and when I finally got around to returning the item, I realised that odd muse only has a 14 day returns policy (I was 2 days late). I think it’s insane to only allow 14 days to return when the price point of the dresses is pretty high, particularly as the in store returns policy is 30 days and you would have had an opportunity to try the item on before purchase. I contacted the customer service team to explain the situation but they were unable to help me.

4432	oddmuselondon	customer	It was an easy process to order, but when I item came, I had ordered a large as I am a size uk 10/12. And it was very tight on top. I definitely think there are sizing issues. I also noticed when received that it was dry clean only even though it is polyester. I decided I wanted to return as the buttons were slightly gapping at the top it was that tight, and also because it was dry clean only. When I went to process the return via the qr code in the package, you had to pay for return postage and a £5 handling fee. Should a rip off. So I decided to not do the return and try and sell it on Vinted or eBay.	2025-06-08	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f1a0f452e2e0e5c2016b3	0.11930272108843538	neutral	["return", "process", "tight", "top", "also", "dry", "clean", "decided", "easy", "order"]

When I tried to return, they denied it due to the mark despite me explaining the problem and just don't return my emails.	2025-06-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f16ebd97917de67624b39	-0.2825854700854701	negative	["dress", "loose", "mark", "return", "received", "faulty", "seams", "made", "impossible", "zip"]
4444	oddmuselondon	Veronika Lilly	After a lot of consideration, I finally decided to treat myself to the Ultimate Muse Dress — and I couldn’t be happier. As always, the entire process was flawless.This time, all taxes and duties were already included at checkout, which made everything even quicker and smoother — I was genuinely surprised, especially since the previous DHL Express option was already incredibly fast.And the dress itself… it’s an absolute dream. It makes me feel confident, empowered, and is beautifully tailored. You can truly feel the passion and attention to detail that went into both the design and the craftsmanship.A huge compliment and heartfelt thank you!	2025-06-08	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f168a2e0980f68a3cb818	0.23194444444444443	neutral	["dress", "already", "feel", "lot", "consideration", "finally", "decided", "treat", "ultimate", "muse"]

4454	oddmuselondon	Beth	Ordered The Ultimate Muse Halter Neck Maxi Dress for my bridesmaids and couldn’t be happier.The quality is absolutely gorgeous – the fabric feels luxurious and the design is incredibly flattering. The square neckline adds such a beautiful, timeless touch, and the fit gives both girls a stunning silhouette. What’s even better is that my bridesmaids are different heights and sizes, yet the dresses suit them both perfectly. I can’t wait to see them wearing them on the big day! That said, for such a premium price point, I was expecting a slightly faster shipping experience and a more elevated packaging style. A more luxurious unboxing would better reflect the high quality of the dresses themselves.	2025-06-13	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f15446e54f51a9c07db42	0.37313725490196076	positive	["bridesmaids", "quality", "luxurious", "better", "dresses", "ordered", "ultimate", "muse", "halter", "neck"]

4461	oddmuselondon	Clare	Can't rate any highly. I am 5'8 with larger breasts so I was really unsure of how the sizing would work. I went into the store and tried on the dress in white as they didn't have it in the colour I wanted in store. The girls in the store helped me look it up and even managed to find the dress in a similar colour on another website for cheaper. In the store they even had heels to wear to get a feel for the dresses fully. The dress was such amazing quality when it arrived and felt so secure it in all day.

From the moment I walked in, the staff were welcoming, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about the brand. They made me feel completely at ease and took the time to help me find exactly what I was looking for—without any pressure or rush.What really stood out was the attention to detail in both the service and the store layout.. You can tell the brand takes pride in quality and presentation, both in their products and the customer experience.Odd Muse is doing a fantastic job of blending timeless fashion with a luxury feel, all while keeping the atmosphere friendly and approachable. I left the store not just with a great purchase, but with a really positive impression of the brand overall.Highly recommend visiting if you’re in London.

4469	oddmuselondon	Sharon Felder	I love odd muse’s clothes - I have found a dress for my civil I’m a huge fan of and some other lovely dresses. The one feedback I would give, is that I tried on my civil dress in store in a large and it fit like a glove. I then ordered it on sale online and the sizing was completely different - it was very big! It’s a shame as I now must get a credit note for this item as it was on sale, and I had already done a haul of other things I wanted! Otherwise, very happy, just the sizing seems inconsistent :)	2025-06-15	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684f12b35811416ea77b3e18	0.255530753968254	neutral	["dress", "civil", "sale", "sizing", "love", "odd", "muse", "clothes", "found", "huge"]

4492	oddmuselondon	Melitta Nemeth	I would love to write a 5 start review because the dress is really nice and fits amazing and had another purchase for a pre order which is again amazing but my experience with the dress I wanted the most left me sad. I bought the ultimate muse embellished midi dress in white in store, due to being so busy I didn’t take it out of packaging or try it on in the store. When I got home and opened the dress saw that full face of make up in the inside of the dress and other handling marks on the outside too. I returned this dress to the store and got another one which this time checked in store but only the top expecting to only maybe have make up on it.When trying it on at home I saw that this dress had black dirt marks on the bottom and the stitching around the zip was coming apart. Living outside of London I contacted customer service who firstly offered £30 for dry cleaning and fixing of the stitching, which I refused because I expected a brand new dress and due to the delicacy of the dress with the embellishments didn’t want to risk the dry cleaning before even wearing it. The first customer service advisor was kind and processed an exchange. The new dress has arrived but it had three clear drip marks on the belly of the dress. When I contacted customer service again I was offered a %15 refund which I refused because again you expect to receive a clean dress at this price point and exclusivity and also found it insulting that it was £30 in the first place which is higher than the %15 and the answer for that was ‘Just to clarify, the £30 offer was based on the stitching and dry cleaning, which is a bit higher than a general goodwill offer.’ I’m very disappointed with this service, to get three dresses in a row all with dirt marks on them isn’t acceptable.	2025-06-12	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684a91a31b8c348c9b2d7e73	0.08304668304668307	neutral	["dress", "store", "marks", "service", "stitching", "customer", "\\u00a330", "dry", "cleaning", "amazing"]

4497	oddmuselondon	Customer	Ordered The Ultimate Muse Halter Top M and the The Ultimate Muse Sleeveless Top L. I’m normally a standard size UK/Aus 10/M, bust 12C the halter top fits, if any thing a tiny bit tight especially when sitting. Also too small for me to wear a bra with. I tried a L in the halter but was too big and no way to adjust. The Sleeveless runs small, could not zip up the M. The L fits well with a bra. Both are excellent quality. I visited the London shop to purchase so no experience with postal/delivery.	2025-05-30	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684953bda311d24185da6bef	0.1401098901098901	neutral	["halter", "top", "ultimate", "muse", "sleeveless", "fits", "small", "bra", "ordered", "normally"]
4498	oddmuselondon	Megan	Seems great on the surface however, once you try and get a refund, you are at OddMuse mercy.As many, I’ve seen OddMuse plastered over my social media’s and I was after a nice white dress for my home-hen as the bride to be.  I checked out OddMuse as they had stacks of lovely tailored white dresses, perfect. I took my measurements to understand my sizing as I’m a size 12/14, however, they wanted me to get an XXL just due to my boobs, which, is only a 16.  Since when was a L a 12, XL a 14, XXL a 16?  Then the sizing stops.  Not inclusive plus gives a body check on avg sized girlies. I bought a size 12 & 14 due to this.  Parcel arrived quickly, not very well packaged even after spending £300, a brown envelope with the dresses in SheIn-esque bags.  Tried both dresses on, alas size 14 fitted due to my bust but it was so short.  So I decided to return them both.  This is when it gets fun.As the dresses were £165 each, I’d rather do with my cash back sooner rather than later.  I knew there was a 14 days return policy, so thought I’d process it quickly.  Once you request your returns, which you have to pay £5 warehouse fee and the Royal Mail £4.95 postage fee, you are already £10 out of pocket, just to have the pleasure to return to OddMuse.  Oh, then you have 48 hours to use your QR code on returns, before your refund is cancelled.  This shocked me.  A time limit to send your return, so word of advice, make sure you can get to the post office within 48hrs of actioning your return.  I think due to this, this is why there are SO many brand new dresses with tags on Vinted, people who unfortunately missed this window.  I sent my return off, then I waited on the refund notification.  Please see timeline below on how long it took for refund to actually be processed (all days are standard, not working).  OddMuse are quick to take your cash, but are very happy to sit on yours….  Day 1 - parcel received (next day delivery)Day 3 - returns requestedDay 4 - return sentDay 5 - return received by odd museDay 22 - refund notification from OddMuse saying refund will be in my bank within 10 working days Day 25 - payment received in bankOn their T&Cs it states refunds can take 14 working days to process.  This is a lie, as above.  OddMuse is a cowboy company and are making cash off poor fitted dresses, knowing they will be returned as their sizing it shot, to make £5 a pop.  The fact an online retailer, which has little overheads charges you for their refund handling is outrageous.  Happy to pay for P&P but handling is a joke.I would never buy off OddMuse again and I’m telling everyone to stay away, unless they are happy without their cash for nearly a month.	2025-06-05	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6849157c8759b8c1be47695e	0.10347886762360449	neutral	["oddmuse", "return", "refund", "dresses", "due", "cash", "days", "get", "sizing", "size"]

I find their older style clothes are teeny tiny and their new collections come up big just to bare that in mind. Started the return and hit with almost £15 of fees? Insanity!! What is this?

4505	oddmuselondon	M Ellen	I recently bought a blazer in the store and I am very disappointed with how the situation was handled. The blazer was listed with a discount both on the receipt and online, but in the store, the price was later changed to the full amount without any clear explanation. If that wasn’t the actual price, they shouldn’t have listed it that way. When I brought this up, they refused to refund the difference. I used to be a fan of the brand, but after this experience, I won’t be shopping here again. Very poor customer service.. It would have been fair if they had acknowledged their mistake and offered a solution.	2025-06-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68482f001b45acb31d75a853	-0.043125000000000024	neutral	["blazer", "store", "listed", "price", "recently", "bought", "disappointed", "situation", "handled", "discount"]
4506	oddmuselondon	Leona Marcus	I ordered a dress from Oddmuse for my Christmas party in 2024. I bought the drop pearl dress for £175. I wore the dress for 15 minutes before I had a massive rip down the whole left hand side of my body and 6 strands of pearls fell off. I had already arrived at the party so had to feel uncomfortable for the duration as I couldn’t get home to change.I contacted Oddmuse in January due to the busy Christmas period. They refused to let me send the item back and the customer service were just not helpful. They offered me a £25 voucher to get my dress repaired at the dry cleaners. In the end I had enough of there rubbish customer service and settled for a £25 voucher and sold my dress on Vinted for £70! Such a waste as I loved the dress so much.	2025-01-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684804df50040f683c7c37dc	0.01091269841269841	neutral	["dress", "oddmuse", "christmas", "party", "get", "customer", "service", "\\u00a325", "voucher", "ordered"]
4507	oddmuselondon	AH	Absolutely useless customer service! Ordered 2 dresses, one was too small (despite being same style and size to previously ordered). Used their own RM returns label, the parcel - despite being 48h service- is showing as deposited in the shop who had it collected over a week ago. The delivery is clearly lost, I can’t raise a claim as it’s not my return label, customer services refuses to do it, I wanted a credit note to reorder correct size but given everyone reporting horrific issues with refunds will be contacting my bank for indemnity claim/fraud tomorrow and reporting it straight to consumer ombudsman. Absolute disgrace and awful to see so many girls with similar experiences and ZERO responses from the business! Same on Google reviews btw! Avoid online shopping unless you are 100% certain it will fit! Pls check Google reviews and their social media, loads of similar feedback sadly and no one seem to care!EDIT: if you bought online and paid by credit card contact your bank and report it. According to UK law a refund must be processed within 14 days and if you haven’t received it but have proof of postage they will charge it back from the company and process instant refund❤️	2025-06-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6847473f02abd4a6538511aa	-0.059702380952380965	neutral	["customer", "service", "ordered", "one", "despite", "size", "label", "credit", "reporting", "bank"]
4508	oddmuselondon	Ellie	I ordered a dress with next day delivery for an event out of the country as I’d had my eye on it for almost a year and decided that the event was a good excuse to finally buy it. The dress arrived a day later than expected, wasn’t as good quality as I had expected, and then unfortunately didn’t fit around the bust (which felt a bit silly given I’m currently a bit underweight and not that chesty). I happened to be going down from North Wales to London the next day on route to the event/getting the Eurostar - and decided I would try taking it into the store to exchange or return. The staff were rude and unhelpful, providing abysmal customer service which left me feeling horrible. I’ve never come across a shop refusing to let you exchange or return their products to them in-store before and they didn’t need to make me feel stupid for asking. I ended up buying another dress from elsewhere. Fast forward a week and I try to go through the returns process online - and like everybody else giving one star reviews - I encountered the extortionate charges, the lack of communication regarding timelines and generally more pretty appalling customer service. I am so disappointed in this brand, the quality of the clothing, and the service I experienced. As soon as they had my money it was horrible every step of the way. I have nothing but bad things to say about Odd Muse.	2025-05-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6846dbaf43fb9fb4c4c40773	-0.1082304526748971	negative	["dress", "day", "service", "next", "event", "decided", "good", "expected", "quality", "bit"]

When I did look I would have had to of pay to send the item back as well as pay £60 for a top that was made awful with a faulty zip and very bad quality, to add salt in the wound after back and fourth emails with them discussing how disappointed I was they asked me to do a review, I can  also see a lot of other customers have had similar issues of late, your customers make your business and to be treated like this is disgusting.	2025-05-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684685e0c73fd7f6a63ee842	-0.06446969696969697	neutral	["back", "item", "top", "ordered", "size", "holiday", "weeks", "send", "made", "would"]

4518	oddmuselondon	Marie Therese Tierney	I was deeply disappointed by Odd Muse’s sudden decision to close their shop on June 3rd with minimal notice and no explanation. As a loyal customer, I had specifically booked a flight that morning to visit the store, hoping to try on my bridal clothes after previously purchasing my bridesmaid dress there. Their abrupt closure, without any communication or transparency, left me feeling let down by the brand.For a company that prides itself on customer experience, this lack of consideration was unexpected. A simple announcement or reasoning would have gone a long way in maintaining trust and goodwill. I truly regret that I wasn’t given the chance to finalise such an important purchase in person.	2025-06-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6842cd4e03819062e7158792	-0.045370370370370366	neutral	["customer", "deeply", "disappointed", "odd", "muse", "sudden", "decision", "close", "shop", "june"]
4519	oddmuselondon	Kelly	First time ordering with Odd Muse. My dress was unfortunately a little small. I needed the bigger size delivered within a week. I naively selected the exchange process instead of asking for a refund and then ordering the bigger size. With the exchange there was no guarantee I would have the dress exchanged for the bigger size and delivered by the time of my event. I contacted customer service straight away to explain. They responded promptly and cancelled my exchange request and I activated a refund and ordered the bigger size. The speed of the response from customer service made the situation a whole lot less stressful. The dress is a beautiful quality and worth the treat.	2025-06-04	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68416cebcb97cfccd1f4bf4e	0.052083333333333336	neutral	["bigger", "size", "dress", "exchange", "time", "ordering", "delivered", "refund", "customer", "service"]
4520	oddmuselondon	Harriet	I ordered 2 dresses in a M and L. When they arrived the L was far smaller around the chest that the sizing specifications say  and couldn’t be zipped up. This is very annoying as you would expect the measurements that are listed as specific to the item to be accurate, especially when I paid £7 for express delivery. The return process is a joke. Charging £5 postage and £5 processing fee and leaving you weeks without confirmation that the refund is processed. They are clearly understaffed and can’t cope with high volume of returns (probably due to terrible measurement info!).After 14 calendar days - the legal time frame in which a refund must be processed - I contacted them to inform them that this legal time frame had passed and that I would escalate the matter with my card provider and trading standards. Thankfully, by the afternoon my return was processed. It may be coincidence, however remind them of legal regulations if they don’t process your return within 2 weeks!! The whole process cost me £17 and a lot of stress, for two poorly made overpriced dresses. However I will say that customer service responded to me quickly and the major issues with this company likely lie at the managerial level.	2025-05-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6841540b8efa2c55a4c6e625	-0.025370370370370376	neutral	["return", "process", "processed", "legal", "dresses", "say", "would", "weeks", "refund", "time"]
4521	oddmuselondon	Maxine	I ordered 7 dresses and they were packaged in one brown envelope which was ripped to shred. The packaging was too weak to hold the dresses.

4527	oddmuselondon	Vicki Simpson	I ordered a dress on the 2/5/25, it came on the 6/5/25 and it was slightly too small, did the online exchange form and sent it back the next day, I had an email saying they received my return but have have no communication since, I’ve tried using the live chat feature to find out where the new dress is but I can’t get hold of anyone! To make it worse, I bought a second dress in the correct size I needed (I wanted to wear it to a special event), it came, was perfect, wore it for a few hours to the event to find out when I got home, it was faulty, it had pulls all over the front of the dress, for a company that prides themselves on longevity of their clothing, I never thought that would happen after one wear! So I got back on live chat, told them it was faulty, sent over all the pictures and they gave me a returns label, I then received an email two days ago to say the dress return won’t be accepted as there’s evidence it’s been worn… I’ve sent an email response to say, well yes, it’s been worn but it’s faulty, that’s why I’ve had to send it back… still no response, 3 weeks after the initial purchase of the dress and 3 days after getting getting my faulty dress refused! I’m £300 down all because I wanted the perfect dress for a super important event… Don’t even bother ordering from Odd Muse, just get one on Vinted…	2025-06-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/683ea6e41ec9afec314a7192	0.11288258525100629	neutral	["dress", "faulty", "sent", "email", "came", "back", "received", "return", "live", "chat"]
4528	oddmuselondon	Kaitlyn	The worst brand I’ve ever bought from.Tried it once-never again.I bought a dress from Odd Muse in-store. (The store by the way, is the size of a shoe box, perhaps they actually have no money to spend on rent/ don’t care much for their customers shopping experience). When I got home and tried it on again, the quality was shockingly bad. It quickly turned into a very ugly, poorly made garment. I then went online to return it via their portal, only to find it marked as “ineligible for return” (which was completely untrue-the receipt clearly stated it was returnable).I emailed them immediately-no reply. And I mean no one got back to me. I was flying overseas the next day and needed the return processed urgently. There’s no phone number listed anywhere, so there’s genuinely no way to get through to them. A total waste of £135.Side note: I’m convinced they marked it ineligible on purpose, assuming most people wouldn’t bother driving all the way back to the store to return it. It honestly felt like a tactic to keep the money. The lack of a contact number only supports this-it’s a deliberate move to make communication impossible.So, the next day, I drove 45 minutes back to the store, spent 30 minutes finding parking, and paid another £25-all because the online return wouldn’t work. When I got to the store, I calmly but firmly explained the situation. Not a single apology or acknowledgment from the staff. No surprise, no sympathy. That was when it really hit me-I was dealing with a company that is dishonest and fake. When I got home and checked my bank app, I saw that the refund was declined because Odd Muse never completed the processing. They did not send me my refunded money. I emailed again. And again. And again. No response. Not a single word from anyone. Their customer service is nonexistent. I even went on Instagram and saw comment after comment under the founder Aimee Smale’s posts-and on Odd Muse’s own posts-saying the exact same thing I experienced. I also commented on Aimee’s tik tok a few times and instead of replying, apologising and giving me back my money, she BLOCKED me.  Before shopping there, my friend warned me she’d heard terrible things about the brand. I should’ve listened. I thought I’d give them a chance. Big mistake.This company does not deserve a single penny of revenue. I am completely appalled by Odd Muse.If I could give zero stars, I would.	2025-05-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/683b58303c005b47b4121067	-0.0718659420289855	neutral	["return", "odd", "store", "money", "got", "back", "muse", "way", "single", "brand"]

4533	oddmuselondon	Kate	In agreement with the many other reviews I wish I’d read… the Swap protect fee is sneakily added to your basket and literally offers you nothing a company should give you anyway in terms of dealing with delivery issues. Then returns are crazy - both slow and you pay not just for the return delivery but also a processing fee. The worst customer experience I’ve had for a very long time. I am still waiting for my refund after I got an email confirming the return had been received two weeks ago. Feels like a company with a serious cash flow problem…Sizing is also inconsistent- I ordered two different dresses of the same size and one fitted and one was way too small.	2025-05-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68397fb14bdd0cd33068ebd7	-0.18848484848484848	negative	["fee", "company", "delivery", "return", "also", "two", "one", "agreement", "many", "reviews"]
4534	oddmuselondon	Friend of Ted	Wanted to love this brand but I would never buy from Odd Muse again.The customer service - is shocking.The dresses are inconsistent in sizes.They charge you £9.50 to return an item (£5handling,£4.50 postage) in my opinion is obscene, especially when the items are ill-fitting something that I cannot help (for context I bought two of the same dresses in two different colours, one fit, one completely did not).I asked to change my exchange to a refund (as I wasn’t aware it would take 3 weeks to exchange) I was told this wasn’t possible even though I made contact the SAME day I made the return. Bought another different style dress and the proportions are completely out.  So much more I could add here but frankly CBA.	2025-05-20	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68397c18761d2e59d0ee2df7	0.1294871794871795	neutral	["would", "dresses", "return", "bought", "two", "different", "one", "completely", "exchange", "made"]
4535	oddmuselondon	HM	I’ve been shopping with Odd Muse since 2021 and have been an advocate for them for many years now. I decided to treat myself before my holiday to order a new dress and unfortunately, I have to say the quality just isn’t up to where it used to be.To my surprise I then discovered that I’ve had to pay nearly £5 for a return and an additional £5 handling fee, really disappointing from a brand that I’ve loved and trusted for years one processing a return that is no fault of my own.	2025-05-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6838ba7ecdf8c842bd15e91f	0.09621212121212121	neutral	["years", "return", "shopping", "odd", "muse", "since", "2021", "advocate", "many", "decided"]
4536	oddmuselondon	Anna	A really disappointing experience overall.I ordered a new jumpsuit for a work meeting, but when the order confirmation came through, I noticed an unexpected £6 charge for something called “Swap Protect” on top of the £6.95 delivery fee. I definitely didn’t add this myself, and it feels sneaky to include extra charges without clearly asking for consent.When the jumpsuit arrived, it looked terrible. The fit across the chest was odd and sat completely open. It just looked off and unwearable. Then came the return process, which added insult to injury: a £4.50 return postage fee plus a £5 processing fee would be deducted from my refund. Seriously?That’s £22.45 lost on an item that didn’t work at all, and to top it off, it’s been over 8 days since the return was received with no confirmation or refund update.I really wanted to support this brand, especially as I’ve followed the founder on Instagram for years, but honestly it feels overpriced, underdelivers, and the overall customer experience leaves a lot to be desired.	2025-05-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68375be7fc8e433a3f2de789	0.04810606060606061	neutral	["fee", "return", "really", "experience", "jumpsuit", "work", "confirmation", "came", "top", "feels"]
4537	oddmuselondon	ana drozd	Review for Odd MuseI rarely leave negative reviews, but I feel compelled to share my experience with Odd Muse. While the clothes themselves are okay—nothing exceptional but wearable—the customer service is by far the worst I’ve ever dealt with.I had to wait an entire month just to process a simple exchange. There was absolutely no communication from their side throughout this time. I had to reach out to their customer service multiple times because I was left completely in the dark. Even then, I either received no response at all or was met with long delays.This lack of basic customer care is unacceptable, especially for a brand that presents itself as premium. I do not recommend shopping with Odd Muse and would strongly advise others to avoid the hassle of dealing with them.Disappointing experience from start to finish.	2025-05-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6837538bc3d85e2a7694acb7	-0.02631578947368421	neutral	["odd", "customer", "experience", "muse", "service", "review", "musei", "rarely", "leave", "negative"]
4538	oddmuselondon	Shelby Ball	I’ve been a long time followed of the brand and finally pulled the trigger on the embellished trim dress to use for my engagement photos. I spent MONTHS drooling over these dresses and then when I got engaged I knew it was time! As a teacher who basically lives in jeans and tshirts, I was looking forward to having something that met that tailored look I was going for in my photos. My problem started with sizing. Based on the measurements for my pear shaped body, I went with the 3x. Unfortunately, their size chart was off by several inches so I reached out to customer service via email. I asked them about sizing and they made suggestions which were helpful but then customer service pointed out they make no international exchanges. I’m a Florida native and I have NEVER received a package so fast that wasn’t from Amazon. It took two days - so I am confident that they did not ship internationally- even though shipping and fees cost me $50. I pointed this out and I pointed out that I had the Swap protection. This name is easily misleading though - it only takes place if my package is lost. After confirming that I could not exchange but instead return for credit, less my fifty shipping fee, they told me they hoped to earn my trust back one day. I tried asking to speak to someone on the phone but they ignored that piece of my request. As someone who has looked forward to adding a piece from this brand to my collection for over a year now, I am absolutely heartbroken. I want to love it and I want to support the brand - but this is bad business plain and simple. Ill take my too big dress that I paid a LOT for and go spend more money to get it altered to fit my body.	2025-05-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/683748afaf02eabadb26821e	0.021699134199134208	neutral	["brand", "pointed", "time", "dress", "photos", "forward", "sizing", "body", "customer", "service"]

Also customer service is not carrying as I would email them many times about this, not once anyone said sorry to me to call me a wrong name or to delay my refund.

4541	oddmuselondon	Roxy Malek	Awful returns process I had a really disappointing experience with Odd Muse.\t1.\tReturns process failure: I tried to return a dress within the 14-day return window, but the QR code they provided wouldn’t scan. Because of this tech issue, I had to email customer service—one day after the return period officially ended. They still refused the return, even though the delay was caused by their own system. No flexibility. \t2.\tMisleading website: Their site claims they’re stocked in Harvey Nichols London, which they are not. I went to try the dress on in-store, only to be told by staff that they no longer carry the brand. That misinformation directly influenced my decision to buy online.As a new customer, I expected a much better level of service. Between the broken return process and the inaccurate store information, this experience was frustrating from start to finish. I will not be shopping with Odd Muse again unless they show they actually care about their customers.	2025-05-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6831cdeb03d6f7ab698885d6	-0.12954545454545455	negative	["return", "process", "returns", "experience", "odd", "muse", "dress", "customer", "awful", "really"]
4542	oddmuselondon	Lauren	I will not be buying from this brand again. I purchased three items online (all of which I have now returned as they do not fit) and it has effectively cost me over £20 to try them on. The “swap protect” is automatically added to both your initial purchase and your refund so it is very easy to fall into the trap of paying for this unless you are carefully checking your basket before you purchase. Furthermore, the tight refund window of only 14 days can make life difficult and despite them insisting on having their items back inside this time I still have not received my refund over 2 weeks since returning. The whole experience has left a sour taste in my mouth.	2025-05-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68339745595128c04d128325	0.019563492063492064	neutral	["refund", "items", "purchase", "buying", "brand", "purchased", "three", "online", "returned", "fit"]

4544	oddmuselondon	Lauren Jane Kerr	I have not received a refund within 6 weeks, verging on 7, of the item being refunded. I refunded the item originally at the beginning of April to be told they were unable to accept and rejecting my request for a refund. Following my response, with photographic evidence, that the item received was poor quality and not to the standard expected by Odd Muse and their associated pricing. I was further informed on the 12th April, following my detailed response they were happy to accept the refund and that the item was in the process of being returned to me; therefore, I was advised by Odd Muse Support to reject the items from the courier which was done on the 14th April all dates of 2025. I have since emailed over 7 times to receive a response that my refund has been processed. I have since taken to social media to express the urgency of my situation as I have been left 7 weeks without a full entitled refund of the purchase price paid. The actions of Odd Muse are in direct contravention of the Consumer Act 2015 which I have expressed in my last email to both their order email address and press email address in attempts to be given a response and satisfactory solution given the time lapsed without a refund. The item has been in Odd Muse possession since the beginning 16th April (it is widely accepted a package or letter is deemed to have been accepted two days following the date of postage, or in this case return). I am left completely shocked by the experience I have had with Odd Muse, which has not been resolved as of the 24th May 2025.	2025-04-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6831a36e6282ca43de859745	-0.02395833333333332	neutral	["refund", "item", "odd", "muse", "april", "response", "following", "since", "email", "received"]

The add on of the extra charges for the swap protection and admin restock fee are also unlawful and excessive. Under UK law you have a right to change your mind and let the retailer know up to 14 days from when you receive it and then you have a further 14 days to physically return the item.

4552	oddmuselondon	Gabija	I ordered two dresses from OddMuse, both size Medium. One (with sleeves) fit well, the other (sleeveless) was too big. Unfortunately, I missed their 14-day return window by a few days, but I reached out very kindly asking if I could return just the unworn dress. I got a cold, unhelpful reply and a flat-out refusal — no flexibility, no explanation, very slow to respond.Hoping to still make it work, I asked for an exchange instead of a refund. Again, they refused. So I went out of my way to buy the same dress again in Small, only to find that the Small was too small. Their sizing is completely inconsistent.I returned the second dress in perfect condition, unworn, and received no response for weeks — until today, when I was told the dress was “not resellable” because it had glitter on it. I don’t even use glitter! No makeup, no perfume, no accessories — the dress was as-new. Yet they’re refusing to refund me and are sending the dress back.So now I’m stuck with three dresses, none of which fit me, and no help from their team. Completely unacceptable.I do not recommend buying from OddMuse. Unfriendly customer service, rigid policies, sizing issues, and a dismissive attitude.

4559	oddmuselondon	Laura McNamara	Ordered various dresses as sizing is known to be inconsistent. When one of the dresses arrived (the only one I wanted to keep) it had a stain on it. I went through the refund process and I ended up having to pay £23 in returns and handling fees - even though I am based in the UK? They offered me free delivery for my next order due to the damage on the first order but I never took it up. The owner speaks a lot on Tiktok about why they're returns policy is only 14 days but this is 14 days for them to have received it back giving you 2 days to actually get it to the post office from delivery. This company targets young girls and I personally feel like they just try and rip them off.

4563	oddmuselondon	Mansfield Customer	Ordered a dress I was obsessed with for months once it was restocked. It came and didn’t fit despite the fact I measured myself against their measurements online. I paid for SWAP protection and didn’t mind as I thought it would be useful. Apparently not. I returned the item the day after I received it. It took them 10 days after receiving it to tell me they had found marks on the dress. Marks that were not on the dress when I sent it back. I know this as I have photos of the dress. I tried the dress on for no more then 5 minutes. I read reviews on here, Instagram and TikTok stating this is quite a common occurrence but hoped for the better. Unfortunately it seems they was all true. If you are going to shop with this company try to shop in store as it will probably cost less to travel to London then it will to return an item.	2025-05-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/682a1e047068192fd2ef8b29	-0.017424242424242425	neutral	["dress", "item", "marks", "shop", "ordered", "obsessed", "months", "restocked", "came", "fit"]

4568	oddmuselondon	Holly Baker	Will not order from this brand again. I experienced poor customer service and hidden costs. I emailed customer service after my return request was refused for being just one day outside of the returns window. I explained the reason for this and asked that my request be escalated internally at Odd Muse. My request was denied. Whilst I appreciate that my request was outside the returns window, I believed that a 'high fashion' brand would be more understanding especially considering the dresses I ordered are supposed to be their 'best seller' so could easily be resold on and I would be covering the returns fee and handling fee. I believe Odd Muse's return policy is unfair and incorrect. Furthermore, the hidden costs of a 'protection fee' at checkout is an 'opt-out' rather than an 'opt-in' which is extremely unfair. I have since had to look into selling these dresses on and the number of people caught out by Odd Muse's returns policy is shown by the extortionate amount of people selling 'new with tags' Odd Muse dresses online. I hope that Odd Muse reconsiders their return policy and hidden costs.	2025-05-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/682878cacc9990ba15fbde94	0.014818181818181824	neutral	["odd", "request", "returns", "hidden", "costs", "return", "muse", "dresses", "fee", "policy"]
4569	oddmuselondon	Clare	First time cust, I got the ultimate muse embellished midi dress. The style, fit and quality of all their pieces are amazing. Stunning dress, so well made and I never lost a pearl all day and night. I have to commend their customer service also. I ordered several dresses to choose from and a few from another brand at the same time. I chose to keep an OM one and postal returned all the rest. However in my rush I sent my OM return to the other brand and the other brand to OMs return address. The other brand actually didn’t notice but OM emailed me, posted my parcels back to me (I paid postage for my mistake), kindly extended my refund window and allowed me to contact the other brand recall that package and resend them both to the right places. Received my refund within a day or two of them receiving the correct return, whereas I had to chase the other brand almost 11 days after they received it even though it was still within their normal returns window. I’ve seen discourse online about Odd Muse’s fabric choices which can be fair but I’ve never felt so good in a dress as the one I chose for this event. As someone struggling with my body rn I felt so confident and safe in my dress and I know I’ll get so much more use out of it, two friends have already asked to borrow her. Which is great for my value for money in comparison to other dresses around the same price point from bigger brands.

They kept saying they’d prioritize it, but here I am, just days away from my wedding, with no outfit and no clear answer.This has caused me so much stress and ruined what should have been a happy time.

I have bought from them before and returned something that did not fit and was not charged this money. This isn't fair on your customers and put me off ordering from you in future.

4583	oddmuselondon	Alex B	Ordered a few dresses to try for my hen do. The quality is great, and it is a really nice fit. However I've given one star because of their rip-off fees and poor customer service. First of all, they automatically toggle something called a 'package protection fee' which is basically unnecessary and costs £9. It is really sneaky the way this is done, I didn't notice until afterwards and they refuse to refund you for it. They also charged me £4.95 for delivery (you only get free shipping over £200, which seems incredibly high).I needed to return one of the dresses I ordered, which meant a further £4.95 in return shipping costs and a £5 ‘handling fee’. As a business that operates predominantly online, I was genuinely shocked to see such steep costs for basic online ordering and return services. In total, this meant I had paid £23 for basic admin, to have nothing to show for it in return. At some other online stores, £23 would have bought you an entire dress. I emailed the Odd Muse customer service to express my unhappiness at the costs, and was told there was absolutely nothing they could do, not even in way of a goodwill gesture. They tell you that it’s in the small print in the website, but their relationship with their customers is surely more important than the small print- and it’s something they are not prioritising. I will never shop with them again, and having seen other online websites now offering copycat versions of Odd Muse dresses, I would recommend trying those instead.	2025-04-04	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/682364b2e8d6684b2b76d23f	0.052380952380952396	neutral	["costs", "return", "online", "dresses", "ordered", "really", "one", "customer", "service", "something"]

We were dress shopping all day and when we went into Odd Muse we all felt relaxed and welcomed, compared to other not-so-welcoming dress shops. It truly is a testament to the staff who worked there, that we walked away wanting to buy the whole shop.

I still have not received my package and DHL refuses to deliver it without payment.This feels incredibly dishonest and misleading. U.S. buyers, do not trust this company or their shipping policies.

Although it took me awhile to make a purchase, I know I will be a loyal customer, I love everything Aimee and oddmuse stands for and wish this company the very best for years to come!	2025-04-20	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681f49c6510195296c020b98	0.28926091269841275	neutral	["oddmuse", "dress", "aimee", "made", "dresses", "purchase", "black", "best", "purchased", "followed"]

4594	oddmuselondon	Christín Gannon	I’m extremely happy with the clothes that I purchased and with the clothes that fit. I’m disappointed that the clothes I bought were stopped im customs. I had to pay more than $50 more per item. As the clothes were delayed I reached out to the customer service team to say they would be beyond the return policy when I finally received them. They told me not to worry that they would support me. Later that week I received the clothes. I had them 3/5 days including a weekend. I reached out to then return the clothes that did not fit. I’m over a week trying to contact them as the system won’t let me return the items automatically. I have 10 items to return and have emailed customer service MULTIPLE TIMES and their online chat help and receiving NO RESPONSE. I’m keeping 16 items which is substantial. I’m very worried and disappointed with their customer care. Do not ship these items to Canada as they are not helping me return items past return date even though they were in customs for all of that time. So disappointing. I truly hope they fix this.	2025-05-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681dda8947e31b68ba5c184e	-0.011538461538461523	neutral	["clothes", "return", "items", "customer", "fit", "disappointed", "customs", "reached", "service", "would"]

4596	oddmuselondon	Jill	Been dying to order a dress for ages from here but didn’t have anything to buy one for. Finally had a wedding that was just after I had my baby so decided to go for the long black midi dress. Ordered and realised I made a mistake with payment method, emailed straight away asked to change it and was told no (ok fair enough took this one on the chin as was my fault not theirs). But a bit annoying as was instant I realised. Refunded same day I received, dress size was incredibly small. Couldn’t get over my shoulders. Probably would have needed the largest size size possible, I am a uk 12/14.They received my returned dress 22nd April and it’s now 8th May and I have no refund. Emailed twice now so hopefully I get it back soon. I have a new born baby and have told them this a few times I need the money, but no urgency to give me my refund. Also shocking they take off so much of it to keep!Overall very disappointed in this experience as would love to buy one of these dresses (and fit into it lol) but will never order from here again.	2025-05-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681c430219ee917de56857e5	-0.03596681096681098	neutral	["dress", "one", "size", "order", "buy", "baby", "realised", "emailed", "told", "received"]
4597	oddmuselondon	Customer	Please avoid this brand if you are an international customer!!! Their returns policy is ridiculous for international customers and make you pay crazy fees. I was waiting on a response from their customer service team and by the time I had received their response it was outside of the return window and they refused to accept my return. The quality is not good at all for the price and the sizing is way off from described in their sizing guide, hence the reason for wanting to return. Honestly, I would avoid altogether as the quality is not good and the customer service is absolutely awful!	2025-05-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681b78f46f694ccf9fbe993f	-0.22592592592592592	negative	["customer", "return", "avoid", "international", "response", "service", "quality", "good", "sizing", "please"]
4598	oddmuselondon	Laura Hough	So disappointed in this brand. I purchased a dress to try costing me £141. The dress didn’t fit so I sent back and was still charged £19.95 to pay!! This was apparently due to taxes and shipping (I live in the UK and this is a UK brand!) there was also a processing refund fee which I had to pay. At checkout they also added on another fee for SWAP protect. Truly disappointed that just to try a dress and return has cost me nearly £20 for a brand based in the UK where I live. When I approached them about this, they completely refused to appreciate this cost and added fees and would not amend anything. Will not be buying from this brand again, very very poor.	2025-05-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681b782a8c757a31decd2029	-0.12381818181818183	negative	["brand", "dress", "disappointed", "try", "pay", "live", "also", "fee", "added", "cost"]
4599	oddmuselondon	OddMuseCustomer	If I could give zero stars, I would! I had high hopes for this brand but was extremely disappointed. I was charged an absurd amount in unexpected customs fees due to misleading information at checkout as well as undisclosed manufacturing in China— information not available on the site. When I tried to resolve the issue, customer service was unhelpful and it was very difficult to get a timely response through both email and live chat. For a brand that claims to empower women and prioritize customer satisfaction, the lack of transparency and accountability was incredibly frustrating. I will be disputing the charge with my credit card provider and taking my business elsewhere.	2025-04-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681b772452b465262cb34c5e	-0.2476262626262626	negative	["brand", "information", "customer", "could", "give", "zero", "stars", "would", "high", "hopes"]
4600	oddmuselondon	Pamela Pinjuh	I placed an order with Odd Muse on March 22nd and it’s now May 7th — I still haven't received a refund.The order was delayed without notice, and I only found out it was out of stock after I contacted them myself. Despite my hesitation and request for more information, they shipped the item without my approval. I later refused the delivery at Croatian customs on April 4th due to an unexpected €99 charge that was never disclosed at checkout.Since then, the parcel has not been returned to Odd Muse by DHL, and the brand is using this as a reason to withhold my refund. Even worse, they’ve clearly stated they plan to deduct return shipping fees from my refund — despite the fact that I never received the parcel, and did everything correctly from my side.They expect me to bear full financial responsibility for delays, courier issues, and poor communication — none of which were within my control. All while they ignore their own stated policies on delivery timeframes and returns.As someone who works in e-commerce, this treatment is completely unacceptable and unprofessional.Avoid this brand if you're an international customer. You may end up paying for their internal mistakes — and get no support when things go wrong.	2025-05-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681b3ca665d3b89d4459b8c2	-0.0004901960784313773	neutral	["order", "odd", "muse", "may", "received", "without", "despite", "delivery", "never", "parcel"]
4601	oddmuselondon	Paris Mccluskey	I ordered two dresses with this company, their returns policy is ridiculous, paying around £9 to send a parcel back in the same country, where are they making this price up… I am still waiting for them to confirm my return with Klarna this has been on going for over 6 weeks. I am 5’2 and both dresses were way too long I would completely avoid if you are on the shorter size. The quality for the price isn’t worth the hassle of the return policy, I wanted to like this company but as most of the other reviews state I wouldn’t repurchase.	2025-05-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681a81e86b8931de6e12444a	0.048958333333333326	neutral	["dresses", "company", "policy", "price", "return", "ordered", "two", "returns", "ridiculous", "paying"]

You can tell a lot of thought went into the design, and it fits true to size, which is always such a relief when ordering online!What I really love is how versatile it is – I’ve already worn it to an event and also dressed it down with flats for a more casual look.

4604	oddmuselondon	Laura Jayne	I placed an order in April of dresses for my hen do. Odd Muse would not return these because they were 'marked' even though I checked before I returned them and immediately put them back in their bags. Odd Muse then decide they are sending them back, but don't tell you when or provide a tracking number. I would have accepted redelivery however they did not tell me when they were being returned and were left outside my house (£350 worth of dresses!). When I finally realised the parcels were not there. It has now been almost a MONTH sending emails to which they have now stopped responding, after saying management would be in touch 3 weeks ago. Currently £350 down with no dresses either and now being ignored.

4605	oddmuselondon	Annabel  Chapman	Avoid avoid avoid at all costs. I don’t even know where to start with how much I loathe this company.1. The sizing is all off2. By the time my bride had been able to give me my bridesmaid dress, it had slightly exceeded the return date. Absolutely no leeway whatsoever even though I just wanted a straight swap. The dresses come with a huge black ribbon attached to them so I can’t see why they couldn’t just swap the size as all I’d done was tried it on.3. I ordered some more dresses to try and find the right size fit. There is a sneaky hidden £15 insurance payment into your basket with you have to opt out of not in to. After I saw it on my order confirmation I asked them to remove it. Which they said they couldn’t do even though the dresses I ordered were not in stock and were not imminent to be posted out.4. Had to pay return postage and admin fee to send items back. A further £9.5. Took way over 3 weeks to receive a refund (excluding weekends and bank holidays)6. They then didn’t refund one of the dresses as it was “unsellable”. This dress had been tried on in my bedroom. Had all tags attached and the massive ridiculous black ribbon. I work in the bridal industry as a make up artist and I will make sure every bride I meet and all their bridesmaids know to avoid this rip off company.	2025-05-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681875b973e6aa7ceb1cea05	0.11092436974789914	neutral	["avoid", "dresses", "even", "know", "bride", "dress", "return", "though", "swap", "black"]

4609	oddmuselondon	Lauren	The returns policy of 14 days isn’t feasible for large orders of bridesmaids dresses, particularly after waiting 3 months for them due to the items being on pre order. When customers are making such large orders for bridesmaids items at least store credit should be offered after the 14 day period. Dresses look beautiful, however the zips on all 8 of my bridesmaids dresses were difficult to do up & all got stuck on the waistband.	2025-05-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681707698470da873c226628	0.0650297619047619	neutral	["bridesmaids", "dresses", "large", "orders", "items", "returns", "policy", "days", "feasible", "particularly"]
4610	oddmuselondon	Naomi B	The pieces are stunning, I will give Odd Muse that. But the return policy is just a little wild. Having to pay return postage (which is more than the shipping cost) and then a £5 handling fee. All in all I’ve paid £13.45 to receive and return an item, which I didn’t keep - mainly because I couldn’t justify paying the price of the item in the first place. Last time I ordered dresses from OM, there were other hidden fees which were automatically added at checkout which I hadn’t realised, so I lost around another £12 last time. Not to mention that the blazer was horrendously creased upon arrival. I remember joking to myself “If only Aimee could see this, she would be mortified” as I saw her on socials, and I really liked her, so wanted to purchase from her brand. Its put me off purchasing from OM again, because being so tall and struggling for items to fit me, I don’t want to run the risk of having to pay that money everytime, if it didn’t fit me correctly.	2025-05-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6817010fa18537c2c2561a15	0.1513888888888889	neutral	["return", "pay", "item", "last", "time", "fit", "pieces", "stunning", "give", "odd"]

4611	oddmuselondon	Megan	Waited almost a month for a return to be processed. Customer service refused one item as they said it had been worn, marks shown were clearly just from trying on a black top and not stains (something that should be expected and could be wiped away with no effort). This item had a broken zip and I submitted the refund stating this on the day I collected it so I’m unsure how I could have worn this item. Tags were also still on the item, again clearly showing unworn. For a brand that prides itself on quality, the zip being broken is less than what I would expect. No offer from odd muse to rectify this situation, lack of communication and response. Would expect the brand to pride itself on good experience for customers given the price points, not accusing someone of wearing something and not refunding or at the very least an offer to fix the item. Will not order from them again due to the customer service and wait times for a response. Not the premium brand I thought odd muse were	2025-05-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681631be284867a680e4975d	-0.05243589743589743	neutral	["item", "brand", "customer", "service", "worn", "clearly", "something", "could", "broken", "zip"]
4612	oddmuselondon	Nathalie De Martin	I was really looking forward to my order from Odd Muse, which included both regular and pre-order items. While I did receive a confirmation email, it stated that everything would be delivered together — but there was no indication of when that delivery would take place. Unfortunately, the package arrived almost a month later, while I was on a 3-week holiday.Because of this lack of communication, I wasn’t aware of the delivery date and couldn't plan accordingly or inform them about my absence. By the time I returned and tried to return a few items, the return window had already expired — something that felt quite unfair given that the delay and poor communication were not on my end.I reached out to customer service but was met with a lack of flexibility or understanding, which was disappointing. It’s frustrating to be penalized for something that could have easily been resolved with a proper delivery estimate or update.	2025-04-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68147a6255f1b09f83867fea	-0.13541666666666666	negative	["delivery", "items", "would", "lack", "communication", "return", "something", "really", "looking", "forward"]
4613	oddmuselondon	Gemma Peace	Dreadful customer service! I would have given 0 stars. I had bridesmaid dresses on preorder, they took forever to arrive and because I didn't know when they were coming, one of my bridesmaids went on holiday. When she returned it was just under a week after the returns date and Odd Muse refused to exchange her size for 1 size bigger.. it was brand new, unworn with tags. I spent £900 in total on these dresses and they haven't been the slightest bit accomodating. Brands that are flexible especially for bridal items build a lot stronger loyalty with customers and that is the last item I will be buying from the brand.	2025-05-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6813db9f2c396ea7de04b7c6	-0.1412878787878788	negative	["dresses", "size", "brand", "dreadful", "customer", "service", "would", "given", "stars", "bridesmaid"]

I did feel skeptical about asking for my order to be cancelled or returning items due to some negative reviews on here.

4619	oddmuselondon	Kerri	Returns policy states 14 days for the refund to be processed and to be refunded. My return was back with Odd Muse on 11/04/25, I contacted Odd Muse Customer Service on 17/04/25 as I had no confirmation of refund acceptance as per their policy (only a delivery receipt). At this point I was advised to wait 10 working days (the policy doesn’t actually state working days although I presumed this would be the case). This took us to the 29/04/25 due to bank holidays. I’ve had to chase today (29/04), after which I received confirmation of my refund acceptance and amount, and told this could now take up to 10 working days to appear in my account, taking us to 14/05/25. The total refund value is £175 so not an insignificant amount. I wish I’d seen reviews on their returns policy, process and customer service before I ordered, and I won’t order from Odd Muse again. The returns policy is extremely strict based on other peoples reviews, yet they think it’s acceptable to hold money for an item returned 34 calendar days prior (21 working days after bank holidays are taken into account). The item itself was good quality, hence the 2 star instead of 1, so it’s a shame they let themselves down so much with their customer service and support. There’s also a delivery charge back to Odd Muse of approx. £6 and a handling fee of £5 deducted from your return amount, not to mention the hidden cost for Swap Protect they put on the original order.	2025-04-29	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681148c5c3f198b31e7393bb	-0.004938271604938272	neutral	["days", "policy", "refund", "odd", "muse", "working", "returns", "customer", "service", "amount"]
4622	oddmuselondon	Jessica H	I really wanted to love Odd Muse, but unfortunately I didn’t. The dress itself wasn’t necessarily bad, although I wouldn’t state it is luxury! I opted to return the dress as I preferred another dress which I felt was better value for money. The issue I have is regarding their returns process and the amount of time it takes the issue a refund. I had notification that my dress had arrived back to their site on 9th April and it wasn’t until the 24th April that I received notification to say I’d be receiving a refund. I had to chase numerous times to ask why it was taking so long to issue my refund. Whilst I understand they have up to 14 business days to issue a refund, I don’t feel it is fair to expect customers to wait so long without any updates. As you can imagine, having to wait so long is quite frustrating considering I returned other dresses on the exact same day and received a refund within less than a week. Small business or not, customers shouldn’t have to chase numerous times for an update or be expected to wait so long. I also wasn’t aware that additional fees would be deducted from my returns. Please bear this in mind should you need to return something to Odd Muse. I won’t be purchasing from this company again following my experience and hope they improve their returns system in the future.	2025-04-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/680f93a9f61aeee902318b61	-0.021999999999999992	neutral	["refund", "dress", "issue", "long", "returns", "wait", "odd", "muse", "return", "notification"]

4625	oddmuselondon	Molly	I purchased ‘The Ultimate Muse Split Sleeve Grey Mini Dress’ in a size small and extra small on 30th January 2025. Shortly after trying on the size small, I did not like how the dress fitted (nothing wrong with the dress itself, just a matter of personal opinion). Knowing how I felt, I choose not to try on the size extra small, nor did I take this dress out of the packaging. Both dresses were returned to Odd Muse within 14 days as per the returns policy stated on their website. Both dresses were returned in their original condition, unworn, unwashed and with all original tags and packaging intact as per their returns policy outlined on their website. Soon after, I received an email stating the dress in size extra small (the dress which I did not take out of the packaging), contained an odour and therefore does not meet their above returns policy and cannot be refunded. The other dress (which I did try on) size small however, was eligible for returns and therefore refunded. Hearing their decision was final and the dress was already in the post back to my address, I was absolutely appalled I was not given the opportunity to contest this! Now, explain this, if the dress was not tried on and was not taken out of the original packaging, the item must have been sold to me in an unsatisfactory condition. This is not how I expected to be treated. I was so excited to place my first order with this brand and now it has completely changed my opinion of ordering online in general! I have never been treated so badly by a company! Multiple emails have been sent back and forth but the attitude I have received from Odd Muse is that this is my fault and there is nothing they can do! I am absolutely disgusted by the customer service I have received, and I cannot believe that they are not willing to refund a £135 dress that I did not try on! I have reported Odd Muse to trading standards and I hope that by reading this review, customers will think twice about ordering through this poorly run clothing brand! There is nothing luxury about the service I have received! Having purchased these items through Klarna, I have been lucky to receive their support and three months later, I have finally got my money back. However, please think twice before purchasing as it is just not worth the stress you will go through trying to get your money back!!	2025-04-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/680b9a34d1b82a967696fbcb	-0.10421626984126986	negative	["dress", "small", "size", "muse", "packaging", "returns", "received", "back", "extra", "nothing"]
4626	oddmuselondon	Gillian Wild	Packaging on items was very poor and items received in a torn bag. Unfortunately, the items were no good and I needed to return. The returns portal states a £5 handling fee and no option to print a returns label. Moreover, the return is at the behest of the customer.  Due to the value of my order the Post Office quoted £19:55, making me out of pocket by almost £25! The online chat service is dire with me waiting over an hour and still no response. There is no phone facility available to contact Customer Services. I am really disappointed and will not use this company again. I definitely do not recommend.	2025-04-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/680b84b395305518be5f9f5a	-0.2680357142857143	negative	["items", "return", "returns", "customer", "packaging", "poor", "received", "torn", "bag", "unfortunately"]

4628	oddmuselondon	Natalie S	I had seen a lot online about these dresses and I have to say that they were not too different from what you may find at Boohoo. I liked the fit, but the fabric was not luxurious. I ordered 3 dresses and decided to send them all back and that’s when the issues started. It was sent back straight away and I got the confirmation of receipt on the 7th April and the email says a few days but then I had to email on the 17th to chase up as I did not know if they were accepted or refused. They say it’s 10 business days but not stated in the email. I finally got it through today saying I have been partially refunded. The returns policy says £5 handling fee and you pay for delivery. Apparently the return of 3 items costs me £30! Careful, there’s an opt-in or out charge- claims to be a fast service and £3, somehow it’s £15. Very sneaky if you ask me. All in all, it will take up to 3 weeks from the return for the money to reach my account. Other sites you do not have to pay for returns or you pay for just the returns. Completely puts me off, it’s a hassle, and to be a company who is trying to make a name for themselves, it doesn’t make sense to charge extortionate amounts to return items. It’s hard to keep loyalty and anyone who asks I will say, the clothes are a little overpriced and they charge a lot to return. You should really look at your policy and how you can cut the cost, hardly screams luxurious. I’ve had a back and forth in emails, and they don’t really care. It’s just a this is it, we make enough so whatever. I’ve asked for a full breakdown of the return price I paid and haven’t had one, I don’t get their calculations and they won’t tell me. Now they’re saying I paid £15 for the swap protect (opt in) when I bought the items, but I’ve also paid £15 in my return for it, so overall £30. Doesn’t mention that in their return policy! Awful.	2025-04-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/680ab4efda917e45b0a15548	0.008666666666666654	neutral	["return", "say", "back", "email", "returns", "policy", "pay", "items", "charge", "\\u00a315"]

4633	oddmuselondon	Kevin McGovern	Looking at the clothes online and the fabric composition, I had a feeling the quality wouldn't be great, and when the dress arrived my fears were correct. Charging £180 for a 'high grade' polyester dress, which arrives creased and smelling of plastic makes no sense to me. I don't understand why they call themselves 'Luxury' - surely luxury would be using luxurious, natural fabrics? I like that they use a diverse range of models, in terms of sizes and skin colour, which makes a refreshing change from other brands. The return process is not great. You pay for the delivery, and then pay a £10 handling fee (why?!? no other brands do this, and you are hardly small?) - my parcel arrived with them on 11th April and I received no confirmation, but had to chase them to confirm receipt of my return. I won't be buying from them again - way too pricey for what you get, and the returns process seems created to trip people up.	2025-04-22	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68077f40cabfe60c660fc74c	0.13861111111111113	neutral	["great", "dress", "arrived", "makes", "luxury", "brands", "return", "process", "pay", "looking"]

My measurements haven’t changed, so clearly there’s no quality control.To make things worse, their return policy is ridiculous. For the amount of money you spend, you'd expect way better service and flexibility. This was my first and definitely my last purchase.

Recently sent a return, paid for SD and they still didn't process return until the 10th day. Also they advised they are return a top to me as it had marks on the neck line which was on the garment when received.

4646	oddmuselondon	Paula Kelly	As much as I liked this brand and the founders story I was really so disappointed in the customer service, and the charges, I purchased a dress when it came it wasn’t for me so I had to then pay for the return and have it back within 14 days and it wasn’t 14 days because I received an email immediately telling me if it wasn’t back to them in the 14 days then I wouldn’t get a refund so in reality you had a couple of days and it had to be back. Then I got notified that they had received the dress and that I would receive a full refund within 10 working days so if it was a weekend you were still waiting longer than 10 days. They received it on the 7th of April and I only had notification that they had refunded it yesterday the 15th And my amount that was refunded had £16.45 taken off it £6.45 for shipping and God knows what the other £10 was for so I’ve emailed them to ask. I’m absolutely fuming and will never order from them again because £16.45 is absolutely awful to have to pay. I’m guessing the £10 is there delivery charge. I wouldn’t know because it just says £6.45 shipping and then goes to £16.45 on the next line what a joke.If I ever ordered from this company again, I would go through Selfridge’s or flannels I would never order direct with them. My advice to them would be sort out your returns and your customer service and your policies on returns and charges because your opening stores in New York and London and telling us all how well your doing yet your you’re  ripping People off with your charges.It was the down fall of the original Karen Millen let’s hope it’s not yours too!	2025-04-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68008dfaef6e83f332e2e9df	-0.011696127946127954	neutral	["days", "would", "back", "received", "\\u00a31645", "customer", "service", "charges", "dress", "pay"]

4648	oddmuselondon	Allison Boyajian	Online buyers beware!Would not recommend Odd Muse based on my recent customer service experience.I ordered a dress and very quickly changed my mind after pressing order. I contacted customer service before the item shipped to try and cancel and nobody responded…..Because no one responded, the item shipped.When I reached out again after receiving the item, I asked for a one-time exception to refund the $50 ($50!!!!!) spent on shipping and they would not be flexible. Now I have a dress I don’t want and an exorbitant amount wasted.I expect a higher level of customer care for a brand charging this amount. I’ve shopped with all the big brands and 99% of the time they are attentive and flexible.Also, $50 non refundable for shipping is insane.As a result, I will never shop with Odd Muse again and recommend online shoppers avoid this brand, unless you don’t mind wasting $50.	2025-04-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ffc683b12d31a626ff089e	0.15208333333333332	neutral	["customer", "item", "online", "recommend", "odd", "muse", "service", "dress", "mind", "shipping"]

4670	oddmuselondon	Jen	Although I really loved their line and have ordered over $4k in less than a year, I am disappointed in how they handled an item I accidentally ordered and to tried to return. The item was sent back stating it had a scuff on it. I ordered the item in error and didn’t even try it on. The scuffs could have come directly from factory or could have happened when they “inspected” the item. The product had all tags attached, no make up, no deodorant, no spray tan. Once sent back, I was able  to wipe the this “scuff” off with a baby wipe. I would have been happy to receive a store credit given my loyalty to this brand. Before ordering, beware and just know you’re taking a risk of being blamed if the item is faulty you will be responsible and they will keep your money.	2025-04-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67f68f8f4cdfc693f1ddaf2b	0.1537037037037037	neutral	["item", "ordered", "sent", "back", "scuff", "could", "wipe", "although", "really", "loved"]

4674	oddmuselondon	Heather	The quality of the clothing cannot be faulted. The sizing is a little inconsistent but overall the dresses are beautiful. The customer service, however, leads a lot to be desired.I am currently £175 down with a missing dress (which I returned within the timeframe stipulated), with no support or contact from Odd Muse for a week. I have had to call and case Royal Mail who have been very helpful, and silence still from Odd Muse.Royal Mail have delivered the item to your warehouse, you say you don’t have it - I am still in the dark, £175 down with no dress. You have got to improve your logistics and customer service - this has left such a sour taste after I’ve raved and raved about your dresses.This dress, which I raised an exchange for, is for the evening of my wedding…I have already bought my day dress from Odd Muse for my wedding & was so excited to wear it. The whole brand experience has been totally marred by this really really poor customer experience, so much so that I’m no longer looking forward to wearing the day Odd Muse dress on my wedding day. Which is a horribly situation to be in.I just want a resolution. It’s simple - either send me the S in the dress I requested an exchange for, or you refund the £175 and take up the lost item with Royal Mail or your warehouse - it is not for me to shoulder the responsibility, financial loss, stress and anxiety for your business issue. If someone could reply today please, that would be most welcome.	2025-04-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67f3b36625e2d939d909a2c9	0.0022970085470085475	neutral	["dress", "odd", "customer", "\\u00a3175", "muse", "mail", "day", "service", "royal", "still"]

4678	oddmuselondon	Siobhan Scott	I WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD.Refused to refund a dress as a tag was missing. Despite no evidence. Dress was immaculate and returned on the same day as delivered. Tag was not attached upon delivery. They returned the dress back to me whilst I was on holiday so Royal Mail sent it back to them. They did not check with me what address I wanted it sent to, nor did they provide any evidence of the reason they were denying my refund before this.Whilst they send a blanket response to these reviews, they do not provide any correspondence via email nor any replies. So basically I am out of pocket for a dress I don't even have that there is no plausible reason not to refund.If you check their social media channels, Instagram in particular and look at the comments. Lots of people are having the same issue!In response to the comment below there was no signs of wear to the dress. They are refusing to refund as a tag was not attached but it wasnt there on delivery. The dress was immaculate and they are yet to actually prove otherwise.	2025-02-04	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67efdd2bbe9c2341fef26435	-0.027777777777777776	neutral	["dress", "refund", "tag", "evidence", "immaculate", "returned", "attached", "delivery", "back", "sent"]

4681	oddmuselondon	Laura Williams	I am extremely disappointed with the handling of my refund for order #224389 and the lack of resolution from Odd Muse customer service. Here’s a breakdown of the situation:Order Date: 23/02/2025Total Order Value: £245£92 paid with a gift card£153 paid via debit cardI initiated a return for one item on 27/02/2025 and selected a refund to my debit card, as the £92 gift card portion was already used up and I was keeping the rest of the items.Despite receiving an email on 13/03/2025 confirming that the return was being processed, I didn't realize the refund was mistakenly issued to a gift card. On 25/03/2025, I noticed the refund hadn't been processed to my debit card and contacted customer service. They informed me that the refund had gone to a gift card because part of the purchase was made with one.I clarified on 01/04/2025 that only £92 of the total order was paid with a gift card and that the remainder was paid via debit card. However, I was told that nothing could be done since the refund had already been processed.I’ve now repeatedly requested that the refund be corrected to my debit card, but my request has been ignored. I am only asking for a refund to my debit card for the £153 I paid via debit card – not an additional refund beyond the £92 from the gift card.This is a simple mistake that could have been easily corrected, but customer service has failed to address the issue properly. I am incredibly frustrated by the lack of urgency in resolving this and would appreciate it if someone more senior could review my case and rectify this situation.I would not recommend shopping here based on my experience. Second time I’ve had a shocking experience with OM customer service - I would recommend you read the similar stories on Insta and Trust Pilot before ordering.	2025-02-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ee49a24c18187b216ff488	-0.16794871794871793	negative	["card", "refund", "debit", "gift", "paid", "customer", "service", "order", "via", "\\u00a392"]

It shouldn’t have allowed me to purchase this in the first place and then the lack of communication in this matter for a dress that is for a special occasion AND so expensive is ridiculous.

4683	oddmuselondon	Isabel Harrison	Genuinely some of the worst customer support I have ever experienced. Returned a garment that was denied return for small marks on the neckline (emphasis on small, I had to zoom in), which occurred from the natural wear of a garment when trying something on (something everyone does when buying clothes in-store & online). They have not even allowed me to have the garment back after my return (I spent £55 on it) so I have lost money just through purchasing through them. To add, the garments are poor quality for their price point. Shop elsewhere.	2025-04-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ed56218a8d779673151b59	-0.07777777777777778	neutral	["garment", "return", "small", "something", "genuinely", "worst", "customer", "support", "ever", "experienced"]

4688	oddmuselondon	LM	As a loyal customer of Odd Muse for the past three years, I am incredibly disappointed with how they are currently treating me. I recently purchased the black tracksuit and was so excited to receive it. Upon arrival, I was genuinely happy with the quality. Having built quite the collection over the years, I know exactly how to care for my Odd Muse pieces.I washed my tracksuit on a 20-degree hand wash, following the same care routine I always do. To my surprise, the trousers shrank. Concerned, I emailed Odd Muse on March 19th and received a response stating that there was nothing they could do. I found this response quite unsatisfactory, as I believe this is clearly a fault with the product. I kindly requested to be directed to a manager to discuss the matter further.Since then, I have sent three follow-up emails and, nine days later, I have yet to receive a response. This level of customer service is unacceptable. When I spend £200 on a tracksuit, I expect both the product and the service to reflect the luxury image they project. Unfortunately, while their clothes may exude luxury, their customer service does not.My opinion of Odd Muse has changed, and I sincerely hope they address this issue and improve their customer service for loyal customers like myself in the future.	2025-03-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67e66f3b67a7eb87fa321800	0.04356060606060607	neutral	["customer", "odd", "muse", "service", "tracksuit", "response", "loyal", "three", "years", "receive"]

4691	oddmuselondon	Laura Cullen	I really wanted to love Odd Muse as I admired the owner's story, however the brand is really not what it's trying to be and the quality and service is pretty terrible.It markets itself as luxury womenswear and is priced as such, however the fabric is far from luxury and the sizing is inconsistent. The returns process is TERRIBLE - they charge for returns (which is a reach given how inconsistent the sizing is), and you have 14 days to return. However, what they don't tell you is that once you've generated your return, you only have 2 days to post, and the only carrier option is Royal Mail (the least convenient of all.) If you don't post within 2 days, despite there being a 14 day return window, your return is cancelled. To add insult to injury, despite giving you such a chronically short window to post, once they finally receive your return it takes FOURTEEN days for them to credit your account. This is not the level of service that's expected of luxury brands with the Odd Muse price point.I actually wrote to Odd Muse to share my feedback before posting this review, and the response I received just showed how much they have to learn as a brand.Edit: The response I've received on here just highlights what I'm saying. Having to return within 14 days was never the issue but I seem to be receiving this same copy and paste / chat bot response every time.	2025-03-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67e2dff6fa784b58b40b25b9	-0.03749999999999999	neutral	["return", "days", "odd", "muse", "however", "luxury", "post", "response", "really", "service"]

4704	oddmuselondon	SJ	I wanted to address a concern regarding your return policy, particularly as it pertains to online purchases. According to HMRC's "distance selling" regulations, I am entitled to return an item within 14 days of receiving it and have an additional 14 days to actually send it back. I received my item on February 4th, notified you of my intent to return it on February 12th, and returned it on February 20th—well within the legal time frame.However, it seems your return policy is not fully in compliance with these regulations, as it does not accommodate the necessary time periods or the process for an exchange, which is my specific request. This puts me in a position where I feel my statutory rights are not being honored.Additionally, I made my purchase with a credit card, which provides me extra protection under Section 75. While I understand your company’s return policies are usually stringent, it is important to recognize that these laws exist to ensure fairness for consumers, and it seems your policy may be overlooking these crucial protections.I hope this review prompts a reassessment of your online return policies so they align with legal standards and offer customers the protection they are entitled to. Thank you.	2025-03-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67db463e72c3aae4b669337f	0.06515151515151517	neutral	["return", "policy", "february", "online", "regulations", "entitled", "item", "within", "days", "legal"]

4724	oddmuselondon	ashnavarma	After ordering a dress for an event abroad, I received the dress only a few days before travelling and subsequently found another dress I liked the day before my flight. Unable to return this, I emailed customer service explaining that I’ll be out of the country for 14 days and therefore unable to return the item until I’m back in the country.Customer service outright refused an extension of the returns period despite this difficult circumstances. My second dress was purchased from a competing brand who offered an extension on their returns without me even having to ask. This is my first time purchasing from OddMuse and I’m sad to say this has put me off purchasing again. Customers have the right to change their mind and should be able to return their items within a decent timeframe. Any other brand I have dealt with has been reasonable with this request and offered an alternative.Not impressed.	2025-03-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67d89afdf7d57af99b516bbf	0.03984593837535013	neutral	["dress", "return", "days", "unable", "service", "extension", "returns", "brand", "offered", "purchasing"]

4727	oddmuselondon	Vasare Pienauske	I am incredibly disappointed with my experience at Odd Muse and feel compelled to warn others before making a purchase. I bought a skirt in-store while visiting London, expecting high quality for the price. However, after just one wear, multiple crystals started falling off, making the skirt unwearable.When I reached out to customer service, instead of taking responsibility, they first offered me only £20 to “cover repairs,” which was completely inadequate. Then, shockingly, they suggested that I should find similar crystals myself and take the skirt to a tailor! That is not an acceptable solution, especially for a high-end brand that claims to sell luxury-quality pieces.After pushing back, they finally agreed to replace the skirt but refused to send a new one immediately, even after I provided clear photographic evidence of the defect. Instead, they forced me to return the faulty item first and wait over 10 working days before even considering sending a replacement. Why should I, the customer, suffer a long wait for a problem that was caused by their poor craftsmanship?To make matters worse, after I raised a formal complaint, I was completely ignored. No response, no attempt to resolve the issue, nothing. This shows a complete disregard for customers and a lack of professionalism.This entire process has been stressful, frustrating, and unacceptable. A premium brand should stand by its products and prioritize customer satisfaction—not dismiss valid concerns, ignore complaints, and drag out the resolution process. I have never encountered such poor aftercare service.I strongly advise anyone considering Odd Muse to think twice before purchasing. If you experience any quality issues (which, based on my experience, is highly possible), be prepared for slow responses, dismissive support, and a long wait for any resolution. And if you raise a complaint, expect to be ignored completely.	2025-03-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67d40009e0b58d0fa55db436	-0.09863636363636362	neutral	["skirt", "experience", "customer", "completely", "wait", "odd", "muse", "making", "quality", "one"]

4729	oddmuselondon	Chloe M	I ordered the black square neck midi dress. The quality is very poor. It is not clear from the images or text but the bodice and skirt are different materials which looks awful. The bodice is a nice thick material, the skirt is a horrible shiny fabric. It looks like Shein crap for £145. On top of this, the skirt was covered in white marks. I’m not sure what this is from - storage, mishandling, or poor quality control. Either way, it looks atrocious. So now I’m sending it back and hoping that oddmuse will actually refund me (and also NOT give store credit), which seems to have been an issue for others. Plus the high postage and return fees. So cheeky. Will never be shopping here again.	2025-03-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67d2e27683f918b92398eea2	-0.2309803921568627	negative	["skirt", "looks", "quality", "poor", "bodice", "ordered", "black", "square", "neck", "midi"]

It was so overwhelming that I couldn't even bring myself to keep them out of the box for long. What’s worse, the company’s response to the issue has been completely inadequate. After explaining the situation, they offered me a measly 15% discount. That doesn’t even cover the cost of having them dry cleaned (and of course, they’re dry clean only)! This experience has left me extremely disappointed, and I will not be ordering from them again. Their customer service is clearly lacking, and their compensation offer is an insult. I would advise anyone thinking about buying from them to look elsewhere.	2025-03-04	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67d2cf54ba645a2968486f53	-0.08888888888888886	neutral	["company", "even", "dry", "beyond", "frustrated", "recently", "received", "order", "goods", "arrived"]
4731	oddmuselondon	Megan Trigg	Really disappointed!! Spent £175 on a dress for a special occasion. I am a normal size 14, bought a XXL as I had read it came up really small and this still did not fit me. I don’t even think the 3XXL would have fit and as a size 14, this is not the size I should have to buy! So I returned this - it was pristine! However I have now received an email refusing my refund/return as there’s marks on the hem but the pictures attached show yellow marks on the front of the dress - not the hem. Both myself and mum checked this dress before returning and there was no marks at all. Would not recommend as they are promoting small sizing and writing about the wrong dress.

4732	oddmuselondon	Mia	I had high hopes for Odd Muse, especially after being inspired by the owner’s narrative of empowering women in business. Her approach felt personal and relatable, making me eager to support a brand that seemed to genuinely care about its customers. Unfortunately, my experience with the company has completely shattered that image.I returned £400 worth of dresses because the sizing was so off, expecting a straightforward refund, but instead, I was given store credit, which is not only frustrating but illegal. Customer service responses were nothing more than generic replies that got me nowhere. It's clear that once Odd Muse has your money, they don’t care about providing any real support or resolving issues. Three weeks went by, and my return was still unresolved, so I had no choice but to initiate a chargeback with my bank, which I successfully won.What really upset me is the lack of transparency and integrity throughout the entire process. This isn't luxury fashion. The materials felt cheap, sizing is off and despite what the brand tries to project, it feels more like a marketing ploy than a genuine commitment to quality or customer service. The “friendly” persona the owner presents online is nothing more than a facade. When it comes to handling returns and customer issues, it’s clear that this brand’s values come from the top down, with the owner’s justification for their illegal policies being downright insulting. The £5 handling fee and their returns policy feels completely nonsensical and dismissive.In the recent videos the owner made on PLT’s rebranding, I saw a different side of her. How can she have the cheek to call out PLT while herself not even running a legal returns policy? At least, with PLT, I can get my refund quickly without any problem. The hypocrisy here is unbelievable. On top of that, attacking the owner and his family personally in any criticisms just isn’t cool, no matter how much you dislike the brand.It’s also disheartening to see the brand focus more on luxury marketing, including spending exorbitant amounts to impress celebrities on shows like Selling Sunset, rather than addressing the real concerns of their customers. If you want to shop with a reputable retailer where you’ll actually receive customer care and refunds when needed, go to stores like Harvey Nichols who stocks OM, where your hard-earned money will be respected.In summary, Odd Muse’s behavior and policies have made me question the authenticity of their brand. I feel duped and regret supporting them. If you’re considering buying from them, I highly suggest thinking twice and shopping elsewhere.	2025-01-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67d19ba1b1268dce57b68e11	0.10097505668934242	neutral	["owner", "brand", "customer", "odd", "muse", "care", "like", "returns", "plt", "felt"]
4733	oddmuselondon	LesaMarie Silva	As a first-time customer, the experience with customer service has left me deeply disappointed and disillusioned. I requested a store credit to purchase a dress that would fit me properly. The dresses were never worn, as they were too big. My work travel schedule prevented me from mailing the item within the 14 days timeframe. However, customer service decision to not accept the return / exchange for store credit has made me reconsider ever ordering from your company again.	2025-03-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67d0653657a62e0fb4109512	-0.06999999999999999	neutral	["customer", "service", "store", "credit", "firsttime", "experience", "left", "deeply", "disappointed", "disillusioned"]

4735	oddmuselondon	Naomi Rendell	I ordered a dress from the Odd Muse website which arrived with dirty marks. I contacted their customer service team for a refund, which was granted, but they advised I would have to pay for return shipping + a £5 handling fee. I responded to say I shouldn’t have to pay for return shipping or the handling fee since the dress had arrived in an unsatisfactory condition. After around 15 emails back and forth, they eventually refunded the handling fee but had still charged £8.45 shipping. I raised a dispute with my credit card provider which ruled in my favour and I was refunded the remaining amount. The whole experience was a waste of time and I would not recommend buying from this company.	2025-03-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ce0b47bff4443bec4f28f9	-0.15333333333333332	negative	["shipping", "handling", "fee", "dress", "arrived", "would", "pay", "return", "refunded", "ordered"]

I had the intention of choosing the top that suited best and returning the other. Note I have kept £280 worth of apparel. I returned the Crystal Tee, an hour after the top was received, and was refused a refund as the ribbon was missing. On reflection I looked back at pictures where the ribbon was not attached when I received the package. Customer service were EXTREMELY unhelpful noting they cannot do anything although all other tags were attached.

4738	oddmuselondon	Jessica	Ordered two items from their website following their size guide, which for reference is inaccurate. One of the items was extremely oversized and was sent back for a refund of which I am still waiting for.The customer service representative appears to be the sole point of contact but their responses are exclusively automated, lacking any of the content of your email. While I understand the processing and shipping fees, the timely handling of returns is crucial. Their policy states that returns will be processed within seven working days of receipt, but this is not adhered to.What is the point of having policies that you don’t adhere to? The purpose of having policies is to ensure compliance, and the company’s failure to do so is concerning.I even repurchased the correct size from their London store, where the staff provided excellent assistance. However, despite their efforts, I was informed that an exchange could have been made at the store, while the website contradicts this information.Furthermore, the item I kept developed a hole in the seam after only one wear due to the placement of a label directly through the seam. This issue highlights the disparity between the company’s online presence and the actual quality of its products and services.A real shame and I remain out of pocket. I strongly advise the company to address these concerns promptly. I request urgent contact from the customer service team, rather than generic responses. Additionally, I would appreciate it if the company could refrain from providing generic responses in response to this review, as per the previous reviews you have commented on.	2025-03-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67cbea77d1ff2ac29689e803	0.06470588235294117	neutral	["company", "responses", "items", "website", "size", "one", "customer", "service", "point", "contact"]

Took 3 weeks to get here, dispite paying £10 it was sent tracked un signed 48 and left on a door step. The packagaing was a brown paper bag, the box is so cheap. The package doesnt even come with anything personalised or cute as an expensive new start up brand,nothing that shows this is run buy an small business. Honestly shocking packaging.Would be embarrased to gift, but the fact The earings are something from H&M for £7... tarnished, gold coming off, feel like plastic. SPENT £90 on a gift, they refuse to refund me, Im shocked at how much Oddmuse rave about these, when they are so bad.

4744	oddmuselondon	Katie	I purchased the below order August 24 for my hen do, which was this weekend. I’d never purchased from Odd Muse before as I had always been in sizes above the size range. I purchased this as a dress for inspiration to get into for the event. I didn’t try it on until this past Friday before I headed off, took it out of the odd muse zip lock bag and upon unzipping the pearl to the left of the zip fell straight off, definitely not the quality I was expecting after paying what I did for the dress. If I had worn the dress the whole bottom row would have come lose and fallen off (photo attached).I’m so disappointed as my hen do plans were altered entirely as we then had to factor in a shopping trip to find a dress, adding unneeded stress and expense having already spent on the dress I had on my vision board for months. definitely didn't expect this quality after trying it once and it being in the bag since purchase.	2025-03-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67c84f9dbe547d5b4b73f099	-0.0861111111111111	neutral	["dress", "purchased", "hen", "odd", "muse", "zip", "bag", "definitely", "quality", "order"]
4745	oddmuselondon	Stephanie Morgan	I had an absolutely terrible experience with Odd Muse and their refund policy. I ordered multiple dresses for my wedding, spent £330, and returned them all as they were unsuitable. Instead of refunding my money, they forced me into store credit for a significant portion of my return, despite my clear request for a refund to my original payment method.I understand handling fees, and I accept those, but Odd Muse is outright refusing to return my hard-earned money and is keeping £155 hostage in store credit that I cannot use. I followed all their return conditions, sent everything back in perfect condition, yet they still refuse to issue a full refund.Their customer service is dismissive and unhelpful, showing zero understanding or flexibility—even when it’s clear I have no further use for their products. Their return policy is misleading, and once they have your money, they make it incredibly difficult to get it back.Avoid this brand at all costs if you expect fair treatment, transparency, or decent customer service. I will never shop here again, and I strongly warn others to think twice before purchasing unless you're 100% sure you’ll keep what you buy—because getting your money back will be a nightmare.	2025-02-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67c828d68bef4cd92dc91ddc	0.09333333333333332	neutral	["money", "return", "odd", "muse", "refund", "policy", "store", "credit", "clear", "use"]
4746	oddmuselondon	Jane Bridget	I recently made a purchase from Oddmuse, and I have to say it was the worst shopping experience I’ve ever had. While the clothes initially looked cute, the company's service and policies were absolutely terrible.First, I received a coupon, but it wasn’t fully honored at checkout. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, it was never fixed. To make matters worse, I paid $415 for a polyester outfit, only to find out I would have to pay an additional $60 for an exchange and $40 for a return — both of which felt completely unreasonable. When I asked if I could return the items in store, they refused and insisted I would have to pay the additional $60 for an exchange, no matter what. I regret purchasing from them, especially considering the cheap fabric used in all their clothes.I emailed customer service several times, but the responses were rude, vague, and unhelpful. They never addressed my concerns properly and seemed to care little about resolving the issues. Eventually, I decided to keep the outfit because their return policy is absurd, but when I finally wore it, the diamonds started falling off the same day.This entire experience has been a nightmare. I will never order from Oddmuse again. Their customer service, return policy, and overall handling of my order were awful. I will be sharing my experience on TikTok and Instagram to warn others about this horrible service.

4747	oddmuselondon	g f	I rarely leave reviews, but my experience with Odd Muse has left me no choice. I purchased a white knit jumper expecting a luxury investment piece, yet within just a few months, it has become heavy, stretched, and lost its structure, while the green jumper (same material) bought at the same time remains in perfect condition. For a brand that positions itself as offering “investment fashion,” this is unacceptable.Rather than acknowledging a clear quality issue, Odd Muse has only offered a £15 partial refund “to assist with the expenses associated with fixing the issue”—but how exactly am I supposed to fix a stretched and misshapen knit? Instead of taking responsibility for a product that should not be failing beyond the return window, they have simply shifted the problem onto me, which is highly disappointing. If this is truly an investment piece, then its quality should be maintained beyond the return window, and any issues arising later should be properly addressed.Odd Muse explicitly states on their website that they are “the antidote to fast fashion,” yet dismissing quality concerns just three months after purchase makes me feel this may not be the case which is really sad. I had really wanted to invest in their pieces, believing they would become staples in my wardrobe, but this experience has made me seriously question the longevity and reliability of their products. It’s a shame because I genuinely loved the green jumper and was excited to purchase more, but now I just feel completely let down.	2025-03-04	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67c76089dd18ecb8d4d7678a	0.02589605734767025	neutral	["muse", "jumper", "investment", "quality", "experience", "odd", "knit", "piece", "yet", "months"]
4748	oddmuselondon	gharrison	I bought two bridesmaid dresses from Odd Muse's new bridesmaid range. I bought a size small and medium to make sure one of them fit. I tried the medium on and it fit perfectly, so I didnt bother trying on the small and returned it straight away. I then got an email from Odd Muse saying they wont refund my item as there was an odour on the dress meaning they could not resell. As stated above, I did not try this dress on. They sent the dress back to me, it did not smell. It was still in the same condition it was originally sent to me. They are refusing me a refund even though I have not tried their dress on. I have never had this happen before. I am now stuck with an expensive dress that I cannot fit in to.

The quality (95% polyester and rayon) is not high enough to justify calling this an investment piece and all these additional costs feel unnecessary.

4769	oddmuselondon	Viviane Taenzer	I really love the quality and design of the dresses—they are well-made and look beautiful. However, my experience with the return process and additional fees was disappointing.For customers ordering from outside the UK, be aware that you will have to pay customs duties and taxes. In my case, this added up to over €150 for just three dresses. Additionally, when I tried to return an item, the package was not accepted on-site and was sent back to me, resulting in another €30 in shipping fees. Given this, I decided to keep the item rather than risk another failed return.While the products are great, I highly recommend international customers carefully review the return policy and factor in the extra costs before purchasing.	2025-02-22	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67b99974846ceb1e1ff7fdbe	0.1781818181818182	neutral	["return", "fees", "customers", "item", "another", "really", "love", "quality", "design", "dresses\\u2014they"]

I’ve paid nearly £200 for a dress and don’t expect it to fall apart after one wear.

4777	oddmuselondon	Sandra Bro	My experience was great because the service was excellent at the store.  The staff, Lilli and all the girls were so professional and so nice.  The store is so iconic due to the extraordinary style.  Even the short waiting in line made the experience more exciting.      'Odd Muse' is so exclusive and chic, I really loved it.     The Company are doing the right thing with employing staff who are exceptionally nice.     Also love the individual Poly packaging for each garment, nice touch also that you have a picture of each garment on your order and receipt so you know exactly what you have ordered. This was my second visit and I love each garment I bought.  The beaded dress I bought in Dec. 2023 got me 'noticed' that I was in an 'Odd Muse' outfit!  It is becoming so popular in Ireland where I live.   It was a romantic experience from my husband as he spotted the dress on line and I loved it, we then went to London to get it.  This year was much the same.  I would highly recommend 'Odd Muse'.	2024-12-08	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67b630a453dd7a45ab78938c	0.30495815295815293	positive	["experience", "nice", "odd", "muse", "garment", "store", "staff", "line", "loved", "also"]
4778	oddmuselondon	Ruth Belchetz	I ordered three dresses from Odd Muse. After trying them on at home, I decided to return them all. After returning the dresses, I received an email explaining that one of the returned dresses had been 'rejected' due to it being in 'unsellable' condition. I was outraged, the photos attached were poor quality and you could not even tell if the photo was of the garment I returned. I immediately asked for the clearer photos and an explanation. I waited over a week and received no response but a notification that the dress was being returned to me via the Post Office and I would have the pay the £165 for the dress. This was shocking, no response and just a delivery notification. Upon receiving the dress, I inspected it and found not a single thing wrong with it, i.e. in completely sellable condition. I sent clear photos back to OddMuse and even offered to have a video phone call so that they could review the condition. I waited further for a response and finally received one. They just stated that the return was being rejected. There was no reference to the photographs that I had sent them and no apologies for the time taken to respond to me.I have spent hours going back and forth, I have tried to be reasonable and send photos of the dress or have a video call. I have received horrendous customer service. I call to question OddMuse's sustainability practices as they have needlessly sent an item back and forth that could have stayed at their warehouse to be re-sold to a customer who actually wanted it.I would never purchase from this brand again and I warn others to be wary of ordering multiple items to try them on at home as OddMuse's returns rejections process is completely flawed.I have raised a dispute with the payment processor, Klarna, and hope to get this sorted asap.	2025-02-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67b61cf6173ee4804307e283	-0.17409297052154193	negative	["received", "photos", "dress", "dresses", "returned", "condition", "could", "response", "sent", "back"]

4787	oddmuselondon	Lish!	Honestly never wanted to support a company so much before. The fact that it’s a company which has been built up from the bottom by one woman is so empowering but then to realise that the quality of clothes this company sells is phenomenal. I’m building my capsule wardrobe this year and am loving all my additional odd muse items. I have bought a few from online and have also purchased from Vinted, even when the clothes are being purchased as ‘used’ on Vinted they are still in excellent quality, as if they were brand new. I highly recommend buying from odd muse, they are supplying more and more items now including lounge wear, so there really is something for everyone!	2024-12-12	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67b301e59ce6f4bb11467d34	0.23177156177156175	neutral	["company", "quality", "clothes", "odd", "muse", "items", "purchased", "vinted", "honestly", "never"]
4788	oddmuselondon	Meg Sheedy	I ordered a dress that cost me one over €180 when it came I was also charged €80 customs to get it delivered to the house which I refused to pay as they had stocked in Ireland and I was able to buy without paying customs fee. I do love the products they do fit gorgeously and they are very high-quality but however customer service is shocking. Refunds are being refused and only partial refund has been offered not even to the value of the dress let alone the cost of shipping and customs, et cetera so far I am down almost €100 in pocket And only been offered a fraction of what I paid for the dress. I understand that shipping and certain fees cannot be refunded and I’m totally happy with that but I would like the cost of the dress at least.	2025-02-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67b300a09fe35e8368f9a148	0.13276643990929704	neutral	["dress", "cost", "customs", "refused", "offered", "shipping", "ordered", "one", "\\u20ac180", "came"]

It turns out (so they say) that I checked a box accepting to have a gift certificate instead of my money back.

I sent the dress back 2 days later and have been waiting for 2 weeks for them to confirm that they recieved my return. I reached out 3 times to check this and finally got a response - 2 weeks later. I recieved an email to say the order for my smaller size had been confirmed and it would be packed. I then received a message from the company to say the dress was out of stock, they had no plans to restock the item and as a consolation they had sent me a code for free shipping on my next purchase!! (My first order shipping was free because of how much I spent). I made it very clear at the beginning it was going to be my wedding dress and directly contacted them to confirm if I ordered an exchange they would send it straight away and I would get a smaller size, hassle free. That’s has absolutely not been my experience. I couldn’t be more disappointed in this company and think they need to make these things very clear. The website still says the dress is in stock in the size I need, but the customer service agent said I will not be receiving one.

4792	oddmuselondon	S D	SCAMMERS!!! These are poorly  designed products, they are withholding my money and still haven’t provided the product. STAY CLEAR! I never write reviews but with this company I really want people to understand what they are getting into when they hand their money over. Really disappointed. I would not recommend Odd Muse. Total lack of satisfaction with your products, customers service and failure to deliver a product that fits or return my money.I originally ordered back in Nov 24. Item came late, after Christmas which is why I bought it in the first place. I bought a medium I am a uk 10-12 I checked the measurements. Items came I couldn’t even do them up!! Returned items, I was only allowed to exchange which is infuriating and I am sure against trading regulations when buying an online product. Anyway, I returned for a large, it still didn’t fit. Returned for now an XL exchange as your site says I cannot get my money back and I’m still waiting for my order!!  I am so disappointed with this and expected more from this brand.The only outcome is set out below in capitals so you understand:I DO NOT WANT YOUR CLOTHES I WANT MY MONEY BACK.As far as I am concerned you have taken my money and not delivered a service to me. THEFT?!?!Since I sent the above email I have two different response one saying no you cannot get a refund and the order has been placed - still awaiting delivery of the two items and one saying it can be paused. Very confused but ultimately I do not have my money nor do I have the two dresses I ordered back in November 2024I want my money back Odd Muse!!Also sort your sizes out.

4793	oddmuselondon	Rachel	Ordered the tracksuit in black and must say I’m extremely impressed! I’ve ordered sooo many tracksuits from other brands, paying over £100 -£160 for them to either not fit properly (being 5ft10), bobble after one wash or become itchy/crispy in the material. The odd muse tracksuit is super comfortable, fits me PERFECTLY and has kept its quality after being washed. Love the structured hood and the cosiness. As a naturally cold person, this is the first day I haven’t needed to keep putting the heating on as it’s kept me cosy - as tracksuits should! You pay for quality here and it’s worth it. I shall be wearing this outfit for the foreseeable! Also, delivery was super quick.

The items had never been worn and had the original tags on.

4809	oddmuselondon	Faith	I bought 7 items from this company and was really excited to receive them. To say they pride themselves on quality is outrageous. The stitching on my grey long sleeved dress is totally faulty. I didn’t realise straight away but because I have let them know now (and not within 14 days of purchase), they could not care less, it has been 6 weeks not 6 years! I am absolutely gobsmacked as I spent £1000 on this company so thought I’d be better looked after. I have sent numerous photos and I am receiving the same response each time. I am gobsmacked how a company can constantly talk about how they pride themselves on quality and they make pieces to last years- this is totally incorrect. I have a dress that is completely wasted. The likes of Zara, mango, H&M with prices 5 x less than this brand look after their customers better.  I cannot understand how they are not taking responsibility for this when they charge the amount they do. I was firstly told it happened because I put it in the washing machine when I haven’t even done this! When you spent this much on a dress, I truly think you should be looked after as a customer. I will never ever purchase from this company again. I was going to buy my bridesmaid dresses from here but absolutely not now. You are not protected as a customer in the slightest.  For this to have happened to my dress,  and for it not be a manufacturing issue, I would have had to sit and purposefully pick the stitching out of my dress- please make this make sense!	2025-02-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a8fb3528d9f4944b30143d	0.013068181818181812	neutral	["dress", "company", "make", "pride", "quality", "stitching", "totally", "purchase", "less", "years"]

4812	oddmuselondon	Caroline Rose	I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Odd Muse. I ordered on Black Friday expecting a good deal, only to find that the discount was less than the import charges. Adding insult to injury, they charged a fee of 457,5 DKK (~51 pounds) and claimed that some of it went to the DHL provider—yet they never specified what portion or how much was allocated to DHL in my refund e-mail confirmation. Despite promising a refund within 14 days, my money wasn't returned until February 8 (waiting ~3 months), and I had to contact them four times before any action was taken. They eventually offered me a free shipping token as compensation, but that hardly makes up for the lack of transparency and poor customer service. I cannot recommend Odd Muse based on this experience.	2024-11-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a7ff248354ee075af7ba3b	-0.0391025641025641	neutral	["experience", "odd", "muse", "dhl", "refund", "extremely", "disappointed", "ordered", "black", "friday"]

Their customer service is not existing.I got a gift from my husband which unfortunately didn't fit even though I sized up and measured my body before buying. It was so tight I couldn't close the dress in size M. I'm normally a size XS/S (EU size). So I paid 180 euros for the dress + 30 euro in shipping + 120 euro in import fees. Then I had to pay for the return myself 40 euros. Odd Muse refused to refund the money, but I got a gift card for the dress only (180 euro). Then I ordered something else and paid an extra 30 euro in shipping and got a invoice for another 120 euros in import fees. However DHL returned the parcel back to Odd Muse because the import info wasn't sufficient. I asked them to ship it again or try another address - but they said it's not possible. I can get a new gift card and pay for the shipping AGAIN. So now I've paid 550 euros for a polyester dress made in China which I don't even have. I have no product, only a 180 euro gift card I may use if I want to pay another 30 + 120 euro, bringing the total to 730 euros for ONE dress!	2025-02-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a5fa07247e9b2f4e8a2221	-0.08284632034632036	neutral	["euro", "dress", "euros", "gift", "paying", "got", "size", "paid", "180", "shipping"]
4816	oddmuselondon	Janine Grandjean	Extremely disappointed with my Odd Muse purchase—I had been eager to buy from them for a long time because their Instagram looks amazing. I finally bought a dress, but the sizing was completely off and didn’t match the size chart, so I had no choice but to return it.I was shocked to find that the refund was less than what I originally paid. After reaching out to customer service, I realized I should have read the fine print—on top of paying £25 for return shipping, something I’ve never encountered before.Such a rip-off! I wish I had known beforehand because I would never have ordered.

4817	oddmuselondon	Tayla mason	I live in Australia and even with the $60 shipping, it was better to order direct from the Odd Muse website. Received the dress in a few days. I ordered the maxi collar dress. The material is great and the fit is overall good but if you have a small waist, it’s pretty gappy. If you can try on odd muse somewhere, you should as the sizing is quite different to other brands.	2025-01-24	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a4003af5d390de1e337cb2	0.1412878787878788	neutral	["odd", "muse", "dress", "live", "australia", "even", "shipping", "better", "order", "direct"]

4819	oddmuselondon	Jory JEAN-BAPTISTE Jory JB	I bought some Odd muse clothes during the flash sales in November and I got the ultimate mini skirt, the muse layered maxi skirt as well as the muse Crystal corset and the structured sleeveless top. When it comes to sizing, be sure to take your measurements beforehand. They fit perfectly. If taxes were lower in France, I might have chosen to return the garment to take the next size up and be more comfortable. But as I am loosing weight that’s okay for me. As for the quality of the fabrics: absolutely incredible, I was surprised and super happy to finally see beautiful clothes where when I put the price I know the quality is there.	2025-01-26	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679635d7f4e45da26a3ac8aa	0.4135416666666666	positive	["muse", "clothes", "skirt", "take", "quality", "bought", "odd", "flash", "sales", "november"]

4820	oddmuselondon	ABW	I bought the absolutely beautiful "Ultimate Muse Drape Maxi Dress" to wear to an international wedding. I ordered it in November and the wedding was in early January, I wanted to get it early to make sure it fit and didnt want to gamble on delayed shipping times due to the holiday season. I absolutely loved the dress, its a beautiful fit and the perfect length for my 5'10" self. Sadly, about two hours into the wedding, the fabric on the dress started to pull when dancing and moving around. I hugged one of the bridesmaids and their dress caught on the fabric and created damage to the dress. For a company that says that they pride themselves on the quality and longevity of their products, this was very disappointing. I got home and sent the team pictures and emails asking if they could give me a different dress because I loved it so much but couldn't wear it again because of the damage. The team said that they were very sorry but I was out of the 14 day return window and the best they could offer me was $20 off. Keep in mind the dress was $235 + international shipping and conversation rates. I emailed back saying how disappointing this was and how frustrated I am because I loved the dress. They stated that they escalated the issue and they would be in touch soon. The next email I got was asking about my experience. I emailed again asking for an update to no avail, which is why I am writing this review. If you can afford to buy a $300+ dress to be worn one time and never again, this is the dress for you.	2025-01-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a22d06fb7ab6dafbccbe08	0.16580000000000006	neutral	["dress", "wedding", "loved", "asking", "absolutely", "beautiful", "wear", "international", "early", "fit"]
4821	oddmuselondon	fashion pend	Really disappointed in my Odd Muse order - been dying to order for a long time as their instagram looks stunning. However the sizing is completely off - the size chart in my opinion doesn’t reflect the fit of the items received. I ordered the Ultimate Muse Halter neck top &  Ultimate Muse wide leg trousers. The top quality seemed ok however the trousers are quite thin and see through.They charge a handling fee of £5 which i’ve never experienced before in any online return. So to return the items cost £9.50 in total - £4.50 postage (understandable) & £5 handling fee which I believe is a absolute rip off and wish I had read the small print first as I would never have ordered. Very disappointed and lesson learnt not to trust the latest insta/tik tok trend!	2025-02-03	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a1cad4264b6db5aa8ab773	0.02416666666666666	neutral	["muse", "disappointed", "order", "however", "items", "ordered", "ultimate", "top", "trousers", "handling"]
4822	oddmuselondon	Eman	I purchased three dresses and returned two because the fit wasn’t flattering. However, I only received a refund for one of them. The retailer claims that the white dress I returned has a stain and a hole, but I have video evidence clearly showing that the dress was in pristine condition during my try-on and was immediately repackaged. I am certain that any damage must have occurred on their end. Additionally, the fabric of the white dress seems to be very poor quality, so I am not surprised it became stained/torn. Overall, I’m extremely disappointed with the customer service and the way this refund issue has been handled. I would advise potential buyers to be very cautious before purchasing.	2025-02-04	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a1c413718c0bda221b2b51	-0.0338095238095238	neutral	["dress", "returned", "refund", "white", "purchased", "three", "dresses", "two", "fit", "flattering"]
4823	oddmuselondon	Julia Richmond	Don’t get me wrong clothes are lovely however the customer service is extremely bad . I requested a refund as the dress didn’t fit my daughter for a November graduation and they sent me a credit note. When I eventually got a response I was told I requested this but I hadn't . I was told they couldn’t amend this . After a few more cross emails they eventually gave me a refund but charged me an admin fee £12 . No telephone number . I would be careful using their online service they do-not seem to value their customers this could have been dealt with so much better . They advise I read the small print as I never asked for a voucher instead of a refund  in the first place I shouldn’t have had to pay an admin fee . This is a very dodgy company read all the other reviews	2025-01-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a1b7fdbae6b7ae0387f0ce	0.03653846153846155	neutral	["refund", "service", "requested", "eventually", "told", "admin", "fee", "read", "get", "wrong"]
4824	oddmuselondon	Henrietta	I ordered two dresses and neither size fitted. I returned the dresses following the correct returns process and within the timeline. I received an email from OddMuse on the 11th of Jan confirming that they had received my return and a refund would be issued.A week later I didn't have my refund so I got in touch with customer service. They said they didn't receive my return and that it has been 'returned to sender'. I don't have the items... They said they would follow up, I waited another five days and I have had to chase them about it. This is honestly the worst customer experience. How can my return not have been delivered to them when I got an email saying it has... and even if there's been an error, shouldn't they issue me a refund out of goodwill as it's technically not my fault as I returned the goods following their process? I am so unhappy with the service and will never buy again.	2025-01-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67a09275d59fd09820b0f3ae	-0.14285714285714285	negative	["returned", "return", "refund", "dresses", "following", "process", "received", "email", "would", "didnt"]
4825	oddmuselondon	Kayla Reerslev	I ordered 3 things the mini skit the cropped jacket and a shirt. I think their sizing is a bit weird specially if you’re in the U.S. The shirt fit great but I’m completely in the middle of the M & L for the skirt. When I retuned the shirt and jacket only the jacket was processed at first but upon emailing, the customer service assured me that the skirt would be processed next even though they were in the same box I thought it was weird that it didn’t didn’t get processed at the same time. Customer service emailed me right away and they were very nice. I only gave four hours because the sizing is very weird.  I wish there was an option that you could immediately exchange for the size you want.	2025-02-02	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679fd94994dec96f0bce6a51	0.08267857142857143	neutral	["jacket", "shirt", "weird", "processed", "sizing", "skirt", "customer", "service", "ordered", "things"]

4832	oddmuselondon	Geraldine	When ordering of odd muse my size is XS. Naturally then I ordered a top and a skirt in XS however, I literally couldn’t breathe they were that tight (my weight has not changed since my last order) I tried to initiate a an exchange but the option was only there to exchange the skirt but not the top even though the top was showing as available. I contacted customer service who apologise and issued me with a QR code for a refund which I thought was fair enough. I put both items in the parcel bag and returned however only got notification that the top was returned. I contacted customer to advise but they said they only have received the top and did I have proof that I posted the skirt back. I am not sure how I’m supposed to have proof given both items were returned in the one parcel so I responded by saying surely their stock take would prove the skirt was returned. I was getting no where with them with the skirt and then received an order confirmation email of a size S top on its way. I contacted them again stating the top was no use without the skirt and asked they send me a skirt in S or issue me a refund. I have received no response to my last three emails so basically they have my money and the skirt I ordered. Ignoring the problem isn’t going to make it go away. People work hard for their money and nobody has the right to take it without giving a product in return. Surely the lady who owns this brand understanding herself how hard people work for their money.	2025-01-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679d501bb2850c585efe8eca	0.19228571428571425	neutral	["skirt", "top", "returned", "contacted", "received", "money", "size", "ordered", "however", "last"]

4839	oddmuselondon	Laura Wood	I purchased a white dress from Odd Muse in July 2024 and wore it once before taking it to a professional dry cleaner, following the "dry clean only" care instructions. Unfortunately, after cleaning, the dress turned grey. The dry cleaner confirmed they followed the correct process and stated that the issue appears to be a fault with the dress itself.I contacted Odd Muse on January 11th and initially received a response requesting a letter from the dry cleaner, which I provided. However, since then, I have followed up multiple times (January 14th, 18th, 22nd, and 24th) and have had zero response.It is incredibly disappointing to spend money on what is supposed to be a high-quality dress, only for it to become unwearable after one use—and even worse, for customer service to completely ignore my emails.I had high expectations for this brand, but this experience has been unacceptable. If you're considering purchasing from Odd Muse, be aware that if something goes wrong, you might not get any help at all.	2025-01-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679c5ca135f79cef3a0f0326	-0.06	neutral	["dress", "dry", "odd", "muse", "cleaner", "followed", "january", "purchased", "white", "july"]

4845	oddmuselondon	Ffion Davies	I had a gift voucher and ordered 2 dresses as I know the sizing is weird. My voucher only covered for the one dress so I paid the rest. Upon choosing the size I returned the other dress to which they refused to give me a refund to my card only to my gift voucher. Ridiculous terms and conditions.The dress I did keep is awful quality. Yes it’s thick material but the boning in the dress is not sewn properly and digs in when wearing. Awful customer service as they take a week to get back to your email and there is no number to ring. They have also only even replied to my email when I’ve commented on one of their Instagram posts. To recieve the gift card in the first place it was due to ordering a sale outfit. When I returned this they told me that I hadn’t included the items and were not willing to refund me (until again outing them on insta) as the items were missing but they were unable to provide proof of how the package arrived or weigh the parcel to see if it would match up to the post office receipt. Took about 3 weeks to get sorted as well due to the slow customer service. Not to mention, you have to pay for your items to be protected during shipping?? How odd. I’ve never seen a luxury or budget company do this. Surely if you’re spending £200 online on one item if your dress didn’t arrive that would automatically qualify you for a new dress sent out especially since there is only one tiny store in the UK. It’s not worth the money and the risk of not getting a refund or getting your items at all.	2025-01-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679b6ac70411f94124fbfbd0	-0.16254545454545458	negative	["dress", "one", "items", "gift", "voucher", "refund", "returned", "card", "awful", "customer"]

I did an exchange for a different size and on finally arriving I was away on holiday. I contacted them on the day I returned to be told because it was 3 days outside of the 14 day window they would not process my return for a refund, or even credit. What adds to insult as they’ve been marketing the dress as back in stock on Instagram all day, as it’s part of their main core range but rather than except my return even for credit they’d rather I’m stuck with a dress that doesn’t fit and never buy from them again. Everyone I’ve told can’t believe their attitude towards paying customers. It may be a popular brand for influencers , who leave glowing reviews but they won’t be left with any paying customer long term, certainly none that return.	2025-01-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679ab4e8a5a67a3cafb8d8c1	-0.032234432234432224	neutral	["day", "return", "window", "customer", "told", "even", "credit", "dress", "rather", "paying"]
4850	oddmuselondon	Connie	Pretty sure the only positive reviews on here are their employees or influencers. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. Customer service is dreadful and they will do anything to avoid you returning an item. Ordered a dress and the sizing was way off. Wanted to return but as they charge you a return cost i thought i'd try the larger size. Arrived 4 weeks after I'd returned the original dress while i was on holiday. It was way to big in all the wrong places. Tried to turn but as i was 72 hours over the 14 day return policy they refused. i explained i'd take store credit, again which they refused. At £125+ a dress the attitude towards customers is disgusting. They have ignored my response but they still have time to post 100 times on social media. Their customer service team is shocking and they do not care about their customers at all. Avoid. Support a brand that cares about their customers.	2025-01-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679ab12edf54b2c3ae84ef8a	-0.17619949494949494	negative	["dress", "return", "customers", "customer", "service", "avoid", "way", "refused", "pretty", "sure"]
4851	oddmuselondon	Sarah Kelly	My favourite brand ever! I have the Ultimate Muse Structured Mini in both navy and white, the most upsetting part is I absolutely loved them when I got them but now I am over 2 stone down in weight, they are far too big. Over the last few months I have placed a few orders and had to return sadly (due to being in between sizes). I am hoping to be able to save my pennies and buy replacements of my favourite dresses - plus more now I have reached my goal weight.Amazing material, customer service has been second to none every single time I have spoken to someone. From the second I discovered you just over a year and a half ago to visiting the London store and purchasing the perfume, to now being a loyal follower on all social channels, I rave about odd muse constantly and when I could wear my dresses I was getting compliments constantly. I love the journey you are on Aimee and there is no company on the market quite like it! I have my eye on so many items right now! Being a Scottish gal I don’t have ease access to a shop without travelling but found out this week OM is now stocked in Fraser’s! Can’t wait to go and visit.Keep doing what you are doing! I literally cannot wait to see what the future holds.	2025-01-29	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679aa2b32127774872626e5c	0.13057539682539684	neutral	["favourite", "muse", "dresses", "second", "constantly", "wait", "brand", "ever", "ultimate", "structured"]

The dresses have an inner lining, making them feel incredibly soft against the skin. It’s as if they were tailor-made for me.

Despite it being delivered on a later date to what was on the tracking (often have issues with our delivery address and our building has to go and retrieve them from a local complex) despite explaining this, that I couldn’t have possibly returned within their 14 day window ( even though on my side it hadn’t been 14 days since receiving) they refused to return it even for store credit. I’m now stuck with a dress I paid over £100 I will and can never wear. To add the dress is brand new, unworn, in original packaging with all labels AND part of their current range. Customer service is abysmal for a company charging the prices it is. It’s actually the worst customer service I’ve ever received from any brand. No empathy or consideration given.

4887	oddmuselondon	Tiffany ❤️	I love the quality of the dresses and how quickly they ship internationally. I bought my first Odd Muse dress over the summer thinking it would be a one time splurge... I now have about 6 dresses, 2 tops and counting. I'm obsessed. My only concern is that I am loosing weight and worried my collection may not fit so well next year. I'll just have to stock up again if that's the case. I have noticed that a few items, assuming from older collections they are phasing out, have a bit of a size discrepancy. However, I was able to return these items. Return shipping isn't cheap, understandably since it's going back overseas, but there is an option to get a slight discount on your next purchase via store credit which makes it worthwhile to me.	2025-01-28	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67989e5ef60d5fd7262f2c06	0.08333333333333333	neutral	["dresses", "next", "items", "return", "love", "quality", "quickly", "ship", "internationally", "bought"]

4894	oddmuselondon	Cristina	I couldn't be happier with my choice of this midi-length white elopement wedding dress for my second wedding. From the moment I slipped it on, I knew it was the one. The dress strikes the perfect balance between elegance and simplicity, which was exactly what I was looking for.The midi length feels modern and fresh, while still maintaining the classic bridal vibe. It’s a fantastic option if you want something that feels special but doesn’t overwhelm you. I loved how it allowed me to move freely, perfect for an intimate elopement ceremony.The fabric is soft and has just the right amount of structure—fitted enough to show off my figure without being too tight. I also appreciated how timeless it felt, with clean lines and a flattering silhouette. The understated lace detail along the hem was the perfect touch of romance without being over the top.Since this was my second wedding, I didn't want anything too traditional or formal, and this dress was exactly what I envisioned—elegant, yet relaxed. The simplicity made it feel more "me," and I felt so comfortable and beautiful in it. It was truly a dress that let my personality shine through.For anyone considering an elopement, I would highly recommend this style. It’s a great choice for a low-key, intimate event where you want to look and feel gorgeous without all the bells and whistles. The midi length is chic, and the dress as a whole just radiates grace.	2025-01-27	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679811fd45fa9bf7dea52d8a	0.3469206349206349	positive	["dress", "elopement", "wedding", "perfect", "want", "without", "choice", "second", "simplicity", "exactly"]
4895	oddmuselondon	Chloe Sarson	Despite being so excited about ordering from this company, I have needed to return the two dresses I bought. They are refusing to provide a full refund despite me cancelling the order within 14 days without giving a reason. Their current refund policy on sale items contravenes the distance selling regulations. Their customer service took 5 days to reply to my email asking how I could return the items. I fear in a bid to run the timer down. In the reply to my emails and chasers, I simply got a reply which did not acknowledge the right to cancel under the distance selling regulations I quoted and my several emails. My request for a returns address so I am able to return the item within 14 days of notifying them of my intent to cancel was not given to me in there eventual reply. I feel this again is overt obstruction to me being able to cancel my order. Furthermore the item was not the quality represented by the brand nor expected at the price tag they are charging with the pearl square neckline being sown crooked. Even when suggesting this issue lasted on in my chaser emails, they ignored this matter in their eventual reply. This experience has left a complete distaste in my mouth and I appalled by the lack of knowledge of consumer rights. It is concerning that Oddmuse is able to operate in this manner.	2025-01-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67980fdd4ccd4d68b665d56e	0.10367724867724867	neutral	["reply", "return", "days", "emails", "cancel", "able", "despite", "refund", "order", "within"]
4896	oddmuselondon	Lily Finnegan - Hutchinson	I've been loving Odd Muse's collections recently! Their straight-leg trousers are an absolute game-changer—flattering, comfortable, and effortlessly stylish. They've quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. The quality is amazing, and I always feel confident wearing their pieces. I recommend Odd Muse to all my friends because it's refreshing to find a brand that combines elegance with everyday wearability.	2024-11-29	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67980f3a23aab27c85bed6c3	0.25833333333333336	neutral	["odd", "ive", "loving", "muses", "collections", "recently", "straightleg", "trousers", "absolute", "gamechanger\\u2014flattering"]

4897	oddmuselondon	Seana O'Connell	I can’t recommend Odd Muse enough! I had an issue with my order, and Ranime El Hady went above and beyond to resolve it. The customer service was truly outstanding. On top of that, I receive every order within 48 hours—delivery from the UK to the US! I’ve never experienced such fast and reliable service.  As for the quality, every piece is incredible. Odd Muse has completely transformed my wardrobe. I’ve gone from wearing something once and discarding it to investing in timeless, versatile pieces that I’ll wear again and again. These outfits have elevated my trips and special occasions in ways I never expected.  It’s my wedding year, and I’m so excited to see what they release next. I’m eagerly waiting for more short white dresses and reception outfits—they just can’t bring out new styles fast enough! Odd Muse is truly one of a kind.	2025-01-23	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67980685b2a1fbc56c0c6e05	0.15841332580463016	neutral	["odd", "muse", "enough", "order", "service", "truly", "every", "never", "fast", "recommend"]

4899	oddmuselondon	Victoria Hast	I’m a big fan of Odd Muse. Initially, I bought just one set to “treat myself” to something extra special. Today, Odd Muse is part of my everyday wardrobe and, after two years, has become my go-to brand.I always order online since I live in Sweden, but I did visit their store in London once. The girls in the shop were incredibly helpful and lovely, even though it was a chaotic day with long queues outside.I travelled all the way from Sweden with my mum just to shop at Odd Muse.If I were to mention one downside, it would be the cost—not the clothes themselves, but the customs charges. Since I live outside the UK, the fees add almost £250 extra, though this is, of course, not Odd Muse’s fault as a company. It doesn’t stop me from wanting to shop with them.My favourite brand! I couldn’t recommend them more. Expensive but timeless, and the quality is absolutely stunning!	2025-01-27	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6797fcfd505810b08a05fb6d	0.10573877876509456	neutral	["odd", "muse", "shop", "one", "extra", "since", "live", "sweden", "though", "big"]

4918	oddmuselondon	Lauren	I was really disappointed with Odd muse. Given the hype I really wanted to love it - the clothing is honestly amazing and such good quality. Customer service lets down this company massively and really needs work. They do not respond in an acceptable time frame and made shopping with them extremely stressful. Very short return window. Very good reviews from influencers but as the paying customers the service and quality of customer experience really needs work. Similar band brands such as house of CB or Anne Louise boutique are a much better company with similar quality clothes. Based on clothes only - that’s why I gave them a star as they are very good quality but that’s the only good thing I can say about Odd Muse. Sadly,  as I really wanted to use this company again.	2025-01-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67979a8da2662d597c8b9031	0.17733796296296298	neutral	["really", "good", "quality", "company", "odd", "muse", "wanted", "customer", "service", "needs"]

The shop itself is beautiful with super friendly and helpful staff (I was most recently helped by a lovely Australian who tried her best to help me out for a last minute event). The dresses are gorgeous on, true to size and I always receive so many compliments. In addition to purchasing from the store, i have also purchased online during Black Friday and received my items well on time.

4943	oddmuselondon	Imogen Searra	I've shopped in-store at Odd Muse in Covent Garden, as well as online — and both experiences are equally as incredible. The staff at the physical OM store are wonderful, super helpful, and really professional — my visit was in July 2024, the height of summer, and we were all melting but their lovely attitudes really made for the best shopping experience. OM's online store is easy to navigate and supper efficient — I received my order in a couple of days and was updated regularly (this was for a Black Friday purchase with a super fast turnaround). I couldn't be more of a fan of OM if I tried — the clothing is brilliant quality and exactly as pictured on the website, it's true to size and super glam — everything a Muse needs!	2024-11-29	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679767c6aea7166ffe4e2bc2	0.3728070175438597	positive	["super", "muse", "online", "store", "really", "ive", "shopped", "instore", "odd", "covent"]

I absolutely love each piece, both as a set and individually, as they mix and match effortlessly with other outfits. The ordering process was seamless, and I was thrilled to receive my order within just three days. The quality is outstanding, and I feel amazing wearing them.

4950	oddmuselondon	Sarah AJ	I found the sizing spot on! The dresses I got (the cap sleeve and halter neck) were made with good material that I felt really held me in well and had a nice feel to them. I would also say that just in general the dresses are very accurate to the webpage and look exactly the same so I wasn’t disappointed. My only problem was the zip kept getting caught on the part where the seam changes with the halter neck dress and I needed two friends to help me get it on. It was not a size issue as the dresses fit great but instead I feel that the zips and seams could be made better but overall great;)	2024-12-02	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67975ba4b3e2385dda303698	0.28800000000000003	neutral	["dresses", "halter", "neck", "made", "feel", "great", "found", "sizing", "spot", "got"]

Obviously I rejected the delivery, so my package was returned to Odd Muse. Shipping and returns were paid for by Odd Muse, so they made a loss on this order.

The quality of each piece that I ordered was unreal and unmatched and the fit was generally amazing, so much so that I am on the verge of ordering more shortly! The fit of the Dropped Hem Midi was slightly off in the bust area, but nothing that a little fashion tape could not fix. If you're wondering if you should or shouldn't order from Odd Muse, my recommendation is...DON'T HESITATE, ORDER NOW :) You won't be disappointed.

4972	oddmuselondon	Dulce Pena	The entire experience was absolutely amazing. I had the pleasure of meeting Aimee and the team on NYC opening day. The aura, vibes, atmosphere, environment, customer service, and friendliness was exceptional. The clothes are very good quality. Although some will argue that polyester is harmful, honestly almost everything is made out of it. The pieces feel luxurious and soft on the skin. I tried on and purchased the cap sleeve mini dress in black size L and it fit like a glove. However, I also purchased the white split sleeve mini dress in white size L but unfortunately the arms were extremely tight (I felt like I was loosing circulation) so I had to get it tailored and it is now a regular short sleeve rather than a split sleeve. It is a bummer but I’m still quite happy with my purchases, I understand these things happen and a garment will not fit absolutely everyone equally well. Thank you, Odd Muse.

4983	oddmuselondon	Victoria Vanten	After looking at Odd Muse dresses online for a long time, I decided to invest in a wedding guest dress, instead of investing half as much, for lots of weddings, that I never end up liking/feeling good wearing. I went with the halter midi dress in navy, which arrived very quickly.  Upon first try on, it ended up being true to size and I truly have never been more impressed with a dress. You can tell a woman designed it - their team thought of everything. It's comfortable but form-fitting in the right places, so there's no need for Spanx, the cut is feminine whilst still feeling appropriate for all sorts of more formal settings, and the slit in the back makes it easy to walk. This was worth the investment and I will most definitely be purchasing more capstone pieces from them in the future.	2025-01-02	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6796cb70fad988a9753c8e33	0.3080498866213152	positive	["dress", "never", "looking", "odd", "muse", "dresses", "online", "long", "time", "decided"]
4984	oddmuselondon	Jady	I went to the Covent Garden store in London mid January 2025 and since it is very small, we had to wait to come in. Which was fine because the sales assistant was very kind and  apologetic about it, even though she didn’t need to be. This made the experience already very nice even if we weren’t in the store yet. I have been looking at the mini skirt for a while and also at the halter neck dress and chocolate, but I didn’t want to order online since the clothes are tailor-made and I have a bigger chest and wasn’t sure about my sizing. I wear a large in the dresses with a 34F cup and an extra large on the bottoms since I have also a larger bigger bum. The dresses and the skirts are not too short. They fit perfectly, and the quality is immaculate. You can see that a lot of thought goes into the process of designing And production of the garments. However, this review doesn’t have a five star rating because there are only two dressing rooms and it’s a very small store for such a skyrocketing successful brand. It’s a 9.5 out of 10 due to only two changing rooms. Nonetheless, I would definitely let recommend odd muse!	2025-01-18	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6796c8e81f9a464b7fd07bec	0.1770393374741201	neutral	["store", "since", "small", "even", "also", "bigger", "large", "dresses", "two", "rooms"]

4994	oddmuselondon	Elise	I first discovered Odd Muse in 2020 and knew immediately that it was exactly what I had been looking for. The “Old Money” vibe. The quality and fit of the pieces are unmatched—my first purchase, the “Ultimate Muse Cap Sleeve Mini,” blew me away. The dress hugged my body in all the right places and the compliments I received every time I wore it were endless! Since then, I’ve purchased five more items, and each piece has lived up to the high standard I expect from Odd Muse.As someone living in Australia, I truly hope Odd Muse opens a flagship store here soon. The department stores just don’t compare, and many of the online items are often sold out before I get a chance to grab them!What I love most about Odd Muse is how Aimee has designed pieces that are not only stylish but also timeless wardrobe staples every woman should own.

5046	oddmuselondon	Natalie	This was my first time shopping with Odd Muse and I was so excited! I ordered two dresses: The Ultimate Muse Pearl Trim Midi Dress and The Ultimate Muse High Waist Square Neck Midi Dress. I ordered both dresses in size XS according to their size chart. The first dress, The Ultimate Muse Pearl Trim Midi Dress fit perfectly and I absolutely love it! However, the second dress, The Ultimate Muse High Waist Square Neck Midi Dress was so small I couldn’t even zip it. I had the worst experience trying to get help from customer service. When I ordered two dresses the exact same size and they are no where near the correct size! The return process is awful and with $30USD return shipping costs, I sold the dress instead.	2024-12-01	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67967d5319f8dd31d21165f5	0.06360416666666668	neutral	["dress", "muse", "ultimate", "midi", "size", "ordered", "dresses", "first", "two", "pearl"]

5047	oddmuselondon	Bella	Overall Experience:The dress is stunning! It's incredibly elegant and the white satin feels luxurious and high-quality. I can't wait to wear it for my rehearsal dinner! What did you like about the item:I loved the timeless, chic design and how flattering the silhouette is overall. The satin material catches the light beautifully and adds a touch of glamour. The mini length strikes the perfect balance between playful and sophisticated.Was the fit true to size:While the dress fit well in most areas, it was noticeably tight in the bust for me as a 34DD who typically wears a Medium. I’d recommend sizing up if you have a larger bust to avoid feeling restricted. Otherwise, the Medium fit as expected in the waist and hips.How was your shipping and delivery experience:Shipping was seamless! The dress arrived earlier than expected and was packaged beautifully. Odd Muse clearly puts care into their customer experience.Final Thoughts:I’d definitely recommend this dress for its quality and design, but if you’re fuller in the chest, consider sizing up for a more comfortable fit.	2024-11-15	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67967d0d0ad087c050f36e55	0.25696649029982366	neutral	["dress", "fit", "overall", "satin", "design", "beautifully", "bust", "medium", "recommend", "sizing"]

5102	oddmuselondon	Natalia	Odd Muse makes such quality dresses! It’s great material and flattering designs. The only thing that’s hard with me in the states ordering online is that some in the same size fit differently than others, for example a strapless I got fit well and with a little extra room even but a strapped square neck dress in the same size I can’t get fully zipped up. More consistent would be nice or individual item measurements for each product to help decide if you may need a different size in that particular article of clothing.	2024-12-01	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67965ec579e71429da157a4a	0.1372685185185185	neutral	["size", "fit", "odd", "muse", "makes", "quality", "dresses", "great", "material", "flattering"]

5160	oddmuselondon	Sofia Arkhipova	My favourite brand! I have been purchasing for over two years, now i have dresses, sets and shirts for any occasion and any season. While the fabrics are synthetic, they are robust, nice to touch and snatch me! The material is thick and solid, but i do not experience sweating or any discomfort. I recommend to order your exact size, except for tshirts and tops - i have larger bust and i wish i sized up for them. Please note, if you are ordering from EU - you are gonna have to pay the import taxes on every single piece in your parcel! I live in Germany and often deliver to France, and it normally comes down to 35€ per article of clothing. I wish Odd Muse would open a warehouse somewhere in EU asap! I would rather spend that tax money on more pieces.

5201	oddmuselondon	Kayla Hoffman	My overall experience with Odd Muse was great! I went to the flagship store in London as i wasn't sure about sizing or style & tried on a few different white dresses for my engagement shoot. The staff were super friendly, running up & down grabbing different sizes for me until we found the right one. The dress fits perfect for my body shape and really shows my smaller waist which i love and doesn't hug my hips. I did struggle with the sizing on the tighter fitting dresses a bit as the top half of my body is much smaller than the bottom so i would have needed to get some altering on the top if i went with one of those dresses. I did order online after i made me decision & got a size M and i'm usually a 12 I paid for next day delivery - the packaging was perfect and the dress was in great condition when received.	2025-01-18	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679630b49277cc2c1f4242b4	0.2622063492063492	neutral	["dresses", "great", "went", "sizing", "different", "one", "dress", "perfect", "body", "smaller"]

I purchased the ultimate muse crystal corset and after one wear one of the crystals fell out. It was £125 and I was appalled that had happened. Though I did receive a full refund I had to ask them to refund the SWAP protection as they did not refund it initially. For all refunds you have to pay for return postage and also there is a £5 handling charge so immediately you have to be aware that if you return and item it will cost you at the very least around £10 if you don’t want it or it doesn’t fit! Though I did not have to pay this when the item was faulty I have had to pay this on a previous return.

I bought the embellished midi dress for a work Xmas party & was complimented on it all night. Also hoping to wear this again to a wedding later this year. The thing that keeps me coming back to this brand is the story. I also appreciate a brand that is open about their fabric sourcing and manufacturing. Brand ethics are a huge bonus along with showing size diversity. I work for a female led fashion brand myself so I know how much it means to everyone involved that their work is appreciated by their customers.

Wanted to buy the white one in tall in the London store, but they don’t have any tall versions there, so I have to pay the extra 75pounds to get one dress.	2024-11-19	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67961b77cb1f46bf67144d2a	0.04722222222222222	neutral	["tall", "dress", "buy", "get", "one", "bought", "black", "long", "sleeve", "absolutely"]

5327	oddmuselondon	Gabrielle	Odd muse is my go to for amazing quality staple dresses. I’ve got the Black cap sleeve dress and I wear it all the time! I always get loads of compliments and asked where it’s from. I’ve just gotten the red square neck long length dress and it’s stunning. However, the straps are too long for me and are not adjustable so I’m going to have them shortened by a tailor. I am a size small and 34D. I can’t wait for more simple staples to be released ❤️	2025-01-26	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67961b241e7db622ac58faaa	0.08750000000000001	neutral	["dress", "long", "odd", "muse", "amazing", "quality", "staple", "dresses", "got", "black"]

Her wedding is in 8 weeks, she bought a beautiful dress with pearl hem and wore it once, she wanted to wear it in the evening of her wedding so got it dried clean as per odd muse label instructions and it was ruined, the pearls hanging off etc... she contacted customer service who gave her the run around and now ignoring her email. She did everything that was asked of her, she sent pictures of the dress, a letter from the dry cleaning company and the order code etc… now she’s being ignored by customer services. This is the 4 Th dress she has bought from your company.  You need to do better in treating your customers better.

5412	oddmuselondon	Jordan	I was gifted an odd muse dress from their latest collection released in December. The dress was the ultimate party dress with the jewelled trim around the hem of the dress which cost £185. It has been worn once and I took it to the dry cleaners following the care instructions on the label of the dress and also the website that state ‘dry clean only. The dress came back from the dry cleaners destroyed with the embellishment hanging off around the hem. I contacted odd muse to state that I had worn the dress once, followed their care instructions and the dress was destroyed. I provided proof of dry cleaning,  the care instructions advised on their website and pictures of the ruined dress.Odd muse stated I had to send them a letter verification from the dry cleaners stating the process the dry cleaners followed. I did this which took around 3 days to receive as the dress had to be sent back to the dry cleaning hub to get the letter of verification.I cannot fault the service received by timpsons dry cleaners as they refunded my dry cleaning cost and provided the letter of verification. I sent the letter to odd muse which stated the dress did not withstand the dry cleaning process which was followed in line with care instructions and that the manufacturer (odd muse) must provide a replacement or refund.Odd muse then stated they could not proceed until they received an order number and purchaser name which I did not have as I was gifted the dress. I then managed to source the order number and sent this to odd muse.I am now being completely ignored with radio silence from odd muse: they are the most unhelpful customer service team I have ever come across. It is extremely frustrating jumping through multiple hoops to prove a faulty product. I find their emails extremely condescending especially when they are finished with “if you have any more questions- we are delighted to help” this could not be further from the truth.I am extremely disappointed in the service I have received. I now have a ruined dress with no prospect of resolution despite 3 weeks of emails going back and forth.Odd muse are marketed as a mid luxury brand but this is not a mid luxury product. I am absolutely gutted this has been my experience. I have asked to escalate this further within odd muse with no response. I will now wait the stated 8 weeks and escalate this to the alternative dispute for retail independent organisation to investigate on my behalf.It’s completely unacceptable that a £185 product that does not withstand the dry cleaning process is not replaced or refunded.	2025-01-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6793b56a93bac423056b858a	0.017992424242424254	neutral	["dress", "dry", "muse", "odd", "cleaners", "cleaning", "care", "instructions", "stated", "letter"]
5413	oddmuselondon	Cass	I purchased the Ultimate Muse Midi Pearl Dress in XL from Odd Muse, and it arrived defective. The stitching was uneven, an issue I clearly documented and shared with their customer service team. Despite the obvious defect, they refused to issue a refund, citing their “final sale” policy. Instead, they suggested I “gently push or twist” the pearls back into place—an insulting and dismissive response for a product that should have been quality-checked before shipping.For comparison, I also purchased the Mini Pearl Dress, which does not have the same defect. This proves the issue is specific to the midi dress I received, yet Odd Muse still refuses to take responsibility. They only offered store credit or an exchange, but I didn’t have enough time to wait for another dress to arrive. To make matters worse, they have now stopped replying to my emails entirely, leaving me stuck with a defective product and no resolution in sight.To anyone considering shopping with Odd Muse: think twice. Their “final sale” policy is a shield for poor quality control, and they will not stand behind their products if something goes wrong. If you receive a defective item, you’ll be left footing the bill for their mistakes with no option for a proper refund—and potentially no response at all from customer service.This experience has been incredibly frustrating, and I strongly urge Odd Muse to overhaul their return policies and improve their customer service. Until then, I would not recommend this company to anyone.	2025-01-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679392002a5c32cb4a96bd30	-0.10476190476190475	negative	["muse", "dress", "odd", "defective", "issue", "customer", "purchased", "midi", "pearl", "service"]

5416	oddmuselondon	Morgan	I’ve bought from odd muse a few times and loved the items BUT the customer service is shocking. They are quick enough to respond if you have anything positive to say but when there is an issue they will simply ignore you whilst the owner is posting on social media 50 times a day. So many negative reviews on trust pilot regarding customer service, postage, returns etc. Shocking for a company of this size that charges the prices they do.

5417	oddmuselondon	Abigail Devenney	I would never buy from this store again or recommend it to anyone. They do not disclose that sale items are non-refundable when you checkout. You have to read their small print in their returns policy before you buy from them to know this. Therefore, I wasn’t eligible for my £75 back, I was only offered store credit. Unfortunately, my mother-in-law also fell for this and is having to take it through her credit card company to get her money back. To make this situation worse, they are now claiming that I’m entitled to £0 because there is dust on the dress that I returned. I returned it clean but it’s their word against mine. The rest of the order (around £400 worth) ALSO was not eligible for a refund until I complained. Their customer service team is shocking and they do not care about their customers at all.	2025-01-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679271867f3ef588757a2784	-0.17833333333333332	negative	["buy", "store", "eligible", "back", "credit", "also", "returned", "would", "never", "recommend"]
5418	oddmuselondon	Jennifer Mitchell	I purchased four dresses on the Oddmuse website as options for the evening on my wedding.- Ultimate Muse Halterneck Midi Dress £135.00- Ultimate Muse Midi Pearl Dress £165.00- Ultimate Muse Long Sleeve Collar Maxi Dress £135.00- Ultimate Muse Knitted Long Sleeve Maxi Dress £135.00I would like to preface this review by saying ALL four dresses are marked as full priced items, and are not marked as final sale and not marked as not eligible for return. I checked this before purchasing due to the cost of the four dresses I was ordering (over £500's worth) and have printscreen proof of this.Unfortunately, none of the dresses fitted me properly (I'm very short) and were all very long and one of the dresses was particularly tight. However I cannot fault the quality.Upon trying to return the dresses it stated that one of the dresses (The Ultimate Muse Midi Pearl Dress) could only be returned for store credit. I don't want £165 of store credit when unfortunately the dresses don't fit my height or shape properly and I was unable to exchange it for a dress I did want in my size, as it was out of stock.It's consumer law that I have 14 days to return an item, as long as its in a resaleable condition (all labels are still intact). The dress was not marked as final sale or not eligible for return either on their website, so as far as I am concerned I am entitled to a full refund. I have tried contacting Oddmuse and their customer services team are sending lie after lie. They have tried to tell me that this dress and another dress I ordered (their Halterneck Midi Dress) are both marked as final sale.Not only is this not true, because one can be refunded in full and one cannot but I have gone onto their website to prove that there are no pop-ups and no wording to demonstrate that either of these dresses are final sale.The Pearl Neck Midi Dress dress has also now conveniently disappeared from their website which is the only reason I can think of as to why they won't let me return it. But I do have proof that the Halterneck Dress states NOWHERE that it is final sale.It gets even better than when I try to return 3 x dresses and exchange 1 x dress they then only give you the option of having store credit and not a refund to your card!?Unfortunately, this whole experience means I won't be purchasing from Oddmuse again and would tell everyone to avoid this brand at all costs. They place revenue above customer service and Aimee Smale should not be surprised as to why she's seeing decreases in revenue. Profiteering from your customers is absolutely no way to run a business in 2025.I have contacted the CEDR to help resolve my complaint. I also contacted Aimee personally via email to which, no surprise, she didn't reply.Think long and hard before you purchase from this brand. It will be a costly mistake. I am now stuck with £165.00 credit for a brand I do not wish to shop from and no dress for the evening of my wedding thanks to Oddmuse.-Edit: I have now received an email fromcustomer services to say: ‘Please accept our sincerest apologies for the confusion caused by our previous response. Upon further review, it appears there was a technical issue on our end that prevented one of your items from being lodged for a refund. Could you kindly confirm if you wish to return all the dresses? If so, I’ll be happy to create a new return label for you’.Here’s hoping this refund is sorted.	2025-01-22	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67925eaec93caf4b24ec90f5	0.035278055278055276	neutral	["dress", "dresses", "return", "ultimate", "muse", "midi", "long", "marked", "final", "one"]

It cost $30 to send it back for a larger size.... well guess what? Its almost been a month and I still haven't received my money back. They stopped answering.

They’re returns policy is different for each item although they do not state that on the listing, it’s complete false advertising and an absolutely horrendous way to operate business. PLEASE DO NOT USE! Above that, the quality was awful, dresses  are totally different to how they look, the fit was completely wrong as per the listing.

I love your clothes and your brand, but this really calls into question the entire logistics. It's unacceptable to have so many problems after having shopped twice and having errors twice.	2025-01-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/678ae9f9e26f5b3fa33c3e4b	0.18035714285714285	neutral	["ive", "problem", "back", "still", "twice", "helloive", "opened", "shrinkwrapped", "packaging", "purchases"]
5433	oddmuselondon	alex	I want to say that I love the product. Ordered a few orders of dresses for myself and some friends to try on for some holiday parties not realizing that these could be stopped by US customs and held with a 30% duty fee on top of the order cost when ordering to the US. This seems to be because I placed many orders in a short period of time and exceed an expected threshold for "personal use" imports. DHL alerted me that if I did not pay the duty that it would be returned to the sender and as I only planed to keep a dress or two and didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars in duty. Therefore, I had them returned to the sender. One order didn't get stopped at customs and I kept 2 dresses and love them. Up to this point I don't think there is anything the Company did wrong other than it would be lovely if they had a PSA for US customers or US warehouse especially if they want to expand their US customer base. I reached out to customer service and they said they would refund me once the received the orders. A few weeks went by and no word or activity from them so I tracked down the return shipping information from DHL and the orders had been returned to Oddmuse for over a week. I got reached back out to customer service and they said they would get it sorted in the next few days but I only got refunded for 1 order and they charged me the duty fee!! makes no sense since I did not import these items to the US. It has been almost a month since the orders returned to them and I followed up 2 times and have heard no response. The remaining orders I need refunded is over $1,000 and I can't get a response from them...	2025-01-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/678add2ed02a2c5e9ed3d86c	0.01097222222222222	neutral	["orders", "duty", "would", "returned", "want", "order", "get", "customer", "love", "dresses"]

5436	oddmuselondon	Marijke Warren	Disappointing service from Odd Muse as a first time customer. I ordered a dress in 3 sizes even after following the fit guidance on the website. After returning two of the dresses, Odd Muse are refusing to refund me even though I have kept one dress (due to this being in sale) I don't want the credit note. As an online retailer, it is against consumer rights to not offer compensation within 14 days of returning the item. They have been reported to trading standards, I would highly advise you are careful with online shopping with them, be sure of the product & size before you buy, which quite frankly is impossible to do.You could do better Odd Muse, I kept the dress in the size that fit, it wasn't unreasonable to refund me for the dress that didn't fit.	2024-11-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/678a676006bf3bc0a28c0884	0.041222222222222236	neutral	["dress", "odd", "muse", "fit", "even", "returning", "refund", "kept", "online", "size"]
5437	oddmuselondon	Annika	I recently bought a dress online, and also one in the London store. The dress I ordered an online was a size S but was a little big (I went after the size chart). I tried on the dress online store and that was an XS and sat much better. My recommendation is that if you’re deciding between two sizes go for the smaller one. The design of there clothes are supposed to be really tight for it to snatch and your body. But even if the first dress is a little big I love it so much, and also the second one is my dream dress.

5440	oddmuselondon	Ellie F	Seeing loads of reviews about the same but ordered online paid £6.95 for shipping, they also charged me £9 for Swap Protect which I definitely switched off/ opted out of since I found it odd that a company would charge to “protect your package” as surely they, along with the courier of their choosing, are responsible for that, and then another £9.50 to return the items. In total spent £25 for absolutely nothing. If you do purchase and have opted out of this Swap Protect service, I advise you check your email and bank immediately to be sure that this was not charged anyway.	2024-12-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6787b0a01382433ca3920d8f	0.12592592592592594	neutral	["protect", "charged", "swap", "opted", "seeing", "loads", "reviews", "ordered", "online", "paid"]
5441	oddmuselondon	Jen N	I do not usually write bad reviews, but the customer service from odd muse has been TERRIBLE. The WORST I have ever received. I was in NYC for the day, and I absolutely love the brand, so I decided to stop into their soho location. The store associates were amazing and I ended up trying on and purchasing two of their dresses (same dress in two different colors). They put back the dresses that I tried onto the floor (samples) on and gave me sealed dresses from the back. As soon as I got home (keep in mind I do not live near NYC), I was super excited and tried on the dresses again. The white one was perfect while the black dress (same style, tried on both colors in store), was huge. The tag was not an official factory printed tag, but an odd muse tag with "XS" written in sharpie. The dress was clearly mis tagged with the way it fit. I emailed customer service and they told me there was nothing that they could do, and that I had to go into the store to do the return. I told them that I do not live in the city, and could not make it to the store to do the return, and requested a return by mail or refund. They gave me the wrong product! They said they would escalate the issue and 10 days later no response! I also reached out to the founder of the brand and no response on her end either. I ended up convincing my sister to drive 7 hours to/from the city just to do the return. In the store, the associates confirmed that it was mistagged! I want to reiterate that it was no way the store associates' fault, but the lack of customer service. Absolutely adore the brand, but the customer service/logistics needs to be solved.

5445	oddmuselondon	customer	I absolutely love Odd muse's dress and clothes. I think they are just amazing. Unfortunately I had a negative experience. I ordered a dress on pre order for my wedding. The Dress was extremely short. As I live in Ireland I got hit with a massive tax & customs bill of €90. My Mam was in London so I emailed customer service to ask could she swap it or get the bigger size so I would have a little more length. The email response time was extremely slow and they said no sorry you can't return to the store and offered me online return only. This would mean if I wanted another dress I'd be hit with another customs bill. Mam just brought the dress with her anyways and headed to the store. I emailed again expressing my disappointment in the service and that my mam was going to attempt to return in store. It wasn't until this point they started saying okay we will keep an eye on emails from store. The sales assistants in store were extremely helpful and issued an exchange for Mam. I was so so grateful. I follow Aimee on tik Tok and I love everything got to do with Odd Muse but the online customer service really needs attention as you would hate for something so small to fix would damage the reputation of the brand that everyone loves so much.	2025-01-10	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67842299d33b1bd1268ddf42	-0.01341540404040404	neutral	["dress", "store", "mam", "would", "extremely", "service", "return", "love", "odd", "got"]
5446	oddmuselondon	NP	The midi corset dress looks amazing on and will be a main piece in my wardrobe. The quality is really good even though it’s all polyester the quality they have used is good. My reason for not giving it a 5 star is that I think their size chart is slightly wrong - I’m a size 12 in everything and therefore ordered a Large according to the size chart but when it came felt a whole size smaller and couldn’t breath in it. So I exchanged for an XL - just think the sizing chart should be reviewed. But the exchange was swift considering it was around Christmas/New Years and the communication with them was seamless.	2024-12-20	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6783c7a30a3a94d031f3923f	0.24232804232804236	neutral	["size", "chart", "quality", "good", "think", "midi", "corset", "dress", "looks", "amazing"]
5447	oddmuselondon	Karen	A mixed experience. Initially very disappointed with the communication I received from Customer Service Assistant, Ranime El Hady, with regards to the online enquiry I made about stock availability in the Monmouth Street branch as I didn’t want to travel to London from the south coast if the dress I wanted to try on was not available. Firstly, I was addressed by a completely random Christian name and then a promised response to my query never materialised. I was advised it may take some time to get the answer but I don’t understand how, in this day and age of communication and technology, it was such a difficult question to answer. I took a chance and was very impressed with the ladies in the store on the morning of Saturday 11 January, they couldn’t do enough to help, were knowledgeable about the products, spot on with advice about sizing and entertained my partner whilst I tried dresses on - an absolute credit to the retail industry!A minor point, the dress will need to be professionally pressed before it is worn because it is full of creases where it has been stored in a bag.I would definitely recommend trying garments on, I tried an identical dress in a different colour in the same size and it didn’t fit so my visit was worth the effort.	2025-01-11	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/678377f2d6e24eaed6a64e66	0.01973684210526315	neutral	["dress", "communication", "answer", "tried", "mixed", "experience", "initially", "disappointed", "received", "customer"]

5452	oddmuselondon	Kelsie	I am so disappointed in the customer service provided by Odd Muse. I ordered a dress for Next Day delivery, and then didn't receive a single form of communication until over 48 hours later... The dress arrived too late for what I needed it for, so I obviously returned and prior to doing so I emailed Odd Muse stating I would like a refund of the 'Next Day' delivery paid seeing as they didn't adhere to it (and it was their doing - DPD confirmed they didn't receive the parcel until two days after I ordered), and that I wanted the £5 return fee waived seeing as it was their fault I was returning. I received a response a week later essentially ignoring my requests, and then I receive the returned money another two weeks later and they have actually deducted £10 and not returned the delivery charge either! I know it isn't much, but it is the principle - they made a mistake so should ensure customers are left in the same position as before at the very least?	2024-12-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/677f3b1598decdd825371e62	-0.06551378446115287	neutral	["delivery", "didnt", "receive", "later", "returned", "odd", "muse", "ordered", "dress", "next"]

I originally ordered a dress from oddmuse in a size medium when it came I tried it on and it was slightly too big so I went on the website and chose to swap it with a size small. This is where all the problems started, the dress was never delivered and was sent back to oddmuse. They are now refusing to give me a refund for the dress that I don’t have and will not reply to my emails.

However, working in Logistics, Odd Muse could really help us customers by adding in steps as part of our order. I needed the dress super quick, so I ordered next day delivery and received no other correspondence other than my order had been placed. Stating it had been picked/dispatched would help massively, when I need to know if the dress will arrive in time.

5466	oddmuselondon	Katrina Elizabeth	Really like my first dress (size S) off shoulder black mini. Great quality and true to size & got compliments. Second dress not so great bought 1 month later in same size - same cut (black mini) but with beaded neckline and long arms. This size did not match in any way versus the previous dress and cut. Shame as it was a NYE dress and couldn’t wear it. Exchange now in progress - something I like about the brand is that it offers exchanges. However it’s emails go to spam so they need to check their settings so that updates on exchanges and deliveries can be received in customers’ main inbox. This is the only brand this happens to me on and I’ve seen this issue on TikTok with other customers. The sizing is an issue especially when making things non-returnable or not for exchange. This is a factor that determines our purchase. Also the exchange should be free if based on the fact their own brand size guide isn’t matched. Shouldn't have to “size up” - just make it fit the guide your brand created? This was disappointing as I thought this was one of the brands priding themselves on fit and cut when this is the exact fault at play in this instance.	2025-01-02	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/677bd61c05ed6a12de9177b5	0.1434027777777778	neutral	["size", "dress", "brand", "cut", "exchange", "like", "black", "mini", "great", "exchanges"]

I had to return one of the dresses because it was too small, but didn't know that I could only recieve store credit for it and not a refund back to the original form of payment. Then had to pay to send it back. There might have been a disclaimer somewhere but it wasn't obvious until you start a return.

Also be very carefully of sizing, I’m a size 10-12 and the large was very tight. One dress was received back to the warehouse. Refunded weeks later. The other in the sale I sent a week later, same by Royal Mail and it’s now been nearly 6weeks!- no refund, no credit note. Can’t even access the ‘returns portal’ which doesn’t tell you much even if you can int eh time frame they give. Not if it’s even in transit.

5487	oddmuselondon	Samanta	Even though I love the quality of the pieces I purchased, this brand can‘t afford to have this customer service at these prices.They’re charging so much for their clothes but the customer experience is horrendous! In the first hours of their Black Friday sale they had a website glitch which caused some prices to display at full.Because sizes were selling like crazy I had to act quick and purchased a blazer at full price. It took me about one or two weeks to get the difference refunded to me as their customer service has been entirely unresponsive. I also purchased a jumpsuit that I was afraid wasn’t going to fit me so I ordered a second one separately one size bigger.In the meantime the first order arrived (I had to pay taxes worth 50% of what I have purchased so something isn’t right here I feel like) and the jumpsuit was sitting very well which made the bigger size irrelevant for me to receive.As I haven’t received a shipping confirmation yet I knew I could cancel the order as their own policies state that as long as the order hasn’t been packed OR shipped (!) I could cancel my order.This is when I received an automated answer saying my order has been processed and fulfilled so I can’t cancel my order.I politely made sure to reiterate their own policies to them and insist on cancelling the order.They intentionally delayed their responses until the order was scheduled for pickup and then shipped!!!I contacted my bank to file a dispute and eventually received my money back, I refused the package so it got sent back to them.Judging by the Instagram comments on their account I wasn’t the only one to experience such bad customer service.It’s a sad thing their quality is so good because I’d purchase again, however only if I know my size and can afford to pay 50% of the initial worth on top of everything.

5491	oddmuselondon	Denzel	From a Male perspective this brand is 10/10. My partner had mentioned the dresses in conversation at a time I was conveniently thinking of presents to get her for Christmas. I wanted to surprise her with an Odd Muse dress she wanted but she doesn’t spoil herself enough so wouldn’t get it without thinking 10 times about it - I love her for it. Bought the dress early for Christmas, confirmed the type  with her best friend , boom. Fast forward Christmas Day she opens it. Absolutely loves it and is total shock. Ps. There is more to the story to how Odd Muse went above and beyond for our order.

5492	oddmuselondon	Kate Seddon	I am utterly disgusted by the appalling treatment I’ve received from Odd Muse. I feel obligated to warn others to avoid this company at all costs to save them from enduring the worst customer experience of my life.After nearly four weeks of being blatantly ignored—apart from a dismissive email claiming they are not breaking the law and refusing to issue a refund—I’ve had no choice but to escalate my complaint to Trading Standards and involve my credit card company’s fraud team.When I purchased items on the first day of their Black Friday sale, there was absolutely no mention that the items were non-refundable. Sneakily, two days later, they added a hidden clause stating "final sale," buried in a link you’d have to actively search for to discover that refunds weren’t allowed.I canceled my contract within 14 days as per my consumer rights, and they are now outright breaking the law by refusing to issue my refund. I spent over £300 on multiple items in various sizes as a first-time customer, intending to keep £150 worth of items. But now, they won’t even acknowledge my messages, leaving me completely out of pocket.To make matters worse, they are actively trying to get customers to leave positive reviews by offering gift vouchers in return. This makes it impossible to trust any feedback you see about this company. Their behaviour is deceitful, unethical, and downright disgraceful.I strongly urge anyone considering a purchase to think twice—this is not a brand you can trust. Save your money and shop elsewhere.	2024-11-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/676ef07addb903b6a341f234	-0.1571969696969697	negative	["items", "company", "save", "customer", "breaking", "law", "refusing", "issue", "sale", "days"]

5493	oddmuselondon	Enrika Malakauskaite	Horrible customer service. I ordered a dress and requested to cancel the order within an hour via email. I also sent a message to the Odd Muse Instagram regarding my issue. Four days later  I received no response not even an email informing me that the order had been shipped. The only notification I received was from Royal Mail stating it was out for delivery so I had to refuse the package.

5498	oddmuselondon	Tas	Wish I saw the reviews sooner. Honestly would not buy from this website again. I can’t believe influencers even promote this company. I purchased an item and tried to return as it didn’t look like the website. You have 14 days to return your item. Not only am I charged admin fee but also returning of my parcel. I accidently selected the incorrect method to return and emailed customer service. I have sent multiple emails with no response. I gave up and attempted to return the item despite picking a difficult method before the 14 days. By the time they respond not only have they reset the return portal but I can no longer log in due to the 14 day window. This is ridiculous I’m now having to send another email which who knows how long this will take for them to get back to reopen because they took so long the first time.	2024-12-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/676ac6142d4ffa6edd9261c2	-0.018939393939393936	neutral	["return", "item", "website", "days", "method", "time", "long", "wish", "saw", "reviews"]

5500	oddmuselondon	Dani	The order and delivery experience was fine and the dress appeared very good quality. However, unfortunately the dress didn’t fit me - it was too small around the waist and too large around the shoulders so sadly had to return it and unable to exchange due to the sizing. The brand isn’t cheap and it was my first order so was extremely disappointed that they took £10 off my refund. I understand this is due to shipping (although it feels high very high) but it was only when I returned the order I realised the shipping fee was on the customer plus they charged a service fee too. Just flagging as this definitely puts me off ordering from them again and I probably wouldn’t have ordered in the first place given sizing is so different across stores. Cost of return should have been made clearer during check out especially as it’s higher . Overall disappointed the dress didn’t fit, as it was very nice and as mentioned seemed good quality.	2024-12-16	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6769b815b113386e18e10b78	0.08355809523809522	neutral	["order", "dress", "good", "quality", "fit", "around", "return", "due", "sizing", "first"]

5504	oddmuselondon	Michelle	Really disappointed in this brand. From start to finish experience was a mess. Not international customer friendly at all (I was hit with a €104 customs charge for items which were on sale - ie: they charged me the full customs amount rather than the sale price). Then when I went to return the dress they did not so much as provide a returns label to print off and I had to hand write the address and pay a €13 shipping fee (not even tracked). I worked in luxury retail for 10+ years and found the entire experience very cheap and quite the opposite of what I was expecting. This dress has now cost me €170 and I don’t even have it anymore. I am still waiting for confirmation from the brand that they have even received my return and have found the customer service team very unhelpful. I had saved my money to be able to buy these dresses and only that my return is only eligible for a gift card to be used on another purchase, I will never be purchasing from this brand again.	2024-12-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67692ca0cb43ae4004e04b34	0.09384615384615384	neutral	["brand", "return", "even", "experience", "customer", "customs", "sale", "dress", "found", "really"]

I received a tracking number immediately but the item was not listed as shipped. 18 days later, I had sent three emailed with no response. On the fourth try, I unfortunately, was blunt and abrupt. However, I finally received a response and the customer service agent, Lillie, had my dress sent out that day. Got it in the mail two days later. I am leaving a five star review because they clearly are a growing brand and were unprepared for how popular the sale would be. I get it and it's the holidays.

5513	oddmuselondon	Customer	A very poor and disappointing shopping experience. They take days to respond to your concerns and they don't solve issues at hand. Their return process is slow, complicated and also very expensive. The shipping cost is already expensive for purchases and you have to pay out of pocket again to return them. The sizing is completely off. A medium size of the same style of skirt, different color, is not the same. It’s unfortunate because I love the items, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy from them because God forbid you get the sizing wrong, and you’re in for a very enfuriating experience to send items back.	2024-12-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6765bef98ac46a1540ddb2a5	-0.218	negative	["experience", "return", "expensive", "sizing", "items", "poor", "disappointing", "shopping", "take", "days"]

The customer service is genuinely awful, I understand that this is a busy time of year but it should not be this difficult to get in touch with a brand. I urge Odd Muse to urgently review their returns process and policy and to drastically improve their customer experience.

To top it off their replies are incredibly slow. Please do not be bullied by this company in to accepting 'credit' and not receiving your refund as you are entitled to.

She had offered me an exchange, I certainly do not want an exchange as it is a customers right to receive all of their money back when items are faulty! I also believe if an item is faulty, the customer should not be paying the postage fee to return and the handling fee as this is not the customers fault, that is on the company/business. I have heard nothing since! I’ve messaged on instagram, emailed, and now I am writing a review as a last resort to try and get my money back. It is such a shame as I absolutely love two of the dresses I am keeping, they are really beautiful but their customer service is completely shocking and really lets the whole company/brand down. This was my first experience of buying from Odd Muse and unfortunately it has been an absolutely horrible one. I was so excited to try this brand as I love Aimee’s designs! I am so deeply disappointed with this.

5529	oddmuselondon	Aleksandra	I recently ordered from Odd Muse, and while I’m happy with the dress I received, the overall experience was INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING. It took over two weeks for my order to be even shipped, and during that time, it was impossible to get in touch with customer service. I only got a response after writing on multiple platforms, including social media. That’s when I was informed (out of the blue) that one of the dresses I ordered was out of stock while I was checking 3 days after I placed my order and both dresses were still in stock so not sure what happened here.There was ZERO communication from the brand about this prior. For a brand that positions itself as premium, I expected much better. At the very least, they should’ve notified me immediately, shipped the rest of my order, and followed up about the out-of-stock item. Instead, I was left in the dark.This was far from a premium experience, and I won’t be purchasing online from Odd Muse again.

5532	oddmuselondon	louise	The quality of the clothes is excellent. However I had to wait a month for a refund to be processed which was annoying given the price of the clothing. I received no communication from the given email address despite my frequent attempts to progress the refund. The only way i managed to get a refund is because Klarna got involved. I recommend using a third party if you buy from Odd Muse.	2024-12-17	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6761e21ba4b5a5d2fbbae87d	0.022222222222222213	neutral	["refund", "given", "quality", "clothes", "excellent", "however", "wait", "month", "processed", "annoying"]

5537	oddmuselondon	Georgina Startin	Love the quality and style of their clothing. I find the sizing to be a bit confusing and not always accurate. I went to the London store last month and tried on the midi red dress in xs and it was a tight fit. Then I tried on the tweed skirt in xs but this was too big, so I tried on and bought this in a xxs, which still has a bit of growing room. Which is odd baring in mind my measurements make me a S on the size guide. Last week I ordered the black mini skirt in a size xxs since my other skirt is an xxs but this was then too tight so have had to return and exchange for an xs hoping this will fit better. At the same time I ordered the collared mini dress in a S since that is my proper measurements in the size guide and the xs of the other dress was too small in the shop, and this is a bit big. Other than the issues with sizing the quality is amazing, the ladies working in the shop were very nice and helpful. And their customer service is also great. I will definitely be shopping again.	2024-12-17	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67617e5177566410c5aa7fc6	0.11058095238095239	neutral	["bit", "tried", "dress", "skirt", "xxs", "size", "quality", "sizing", "last", "tight"]

5566	oddmuselondon	Kelly Stevens	I’m very new to Odd Muse and stayed loyal to brands I knew fitted well. Purchased my first Odd Muse dress in September for an Italian wedding and I’ve brought 4 more since plus a top and cardigan! I’m 48, 5ft 3 large chest and small waist, I’m absolutely delighted with the quality and FIT of the items. The fabric and structure are unbelievably flattering, everything hangs and fits where it’s meant to and I feel amazing wearing this brand. If you’re unsure of sizing they are very true to size but if like me you want to be sure, I went to Harvey Nichols to try on my first dress, perfect sizing!

5540	oddmuselondon	Katie	I purchased a dress from Odd Muse during their Black Friday sale and was shocked to discover that it was non-refundable and only exchangeable. This was not made clear at all at the point of purchase; apparently, it was buried in their terms and conditions. This is an utterly disingenuous practice.When I pointed out the law to them (UK consumer regulations), they eventually agreed to refund me "on this one occasion"—but only because they legally had to. If you find yourself in a similar situation, don’t let them pressure you into keeping an item. UK retailers must comply with certain regulations when selling online, and customers should not be misled.To make matters worse, they charged me £13.45 to return the dress, which was far higher than expected. Their policy claims returns cost £5, but they later clarified (after the fact) that this doesn’t include the full charges: they add shipping out, £5 for "handling" the return, and shipping back to them. Once again, this was unclear and misleading on their website.On top of all this, their sizing is completely inaccurate, which means you’re even more likely to need a return.The entire experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. If Odd Muse wants to trash their brand reputation, they’re on the right path. Based on other reviews, I can see I’m not alone in feeling this way. Their so-called "clear terms" and return policy are anything but clear—more like as clear as mud.Buyers beware!	2024-12-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67611de6b8915288548b9bbc	0.017741935483870975	neutral	["clear", "return", "dress", "odd", "muse", "terms", "regulations", "policy", "shipping", "purchased"]

5552	oddmuselondon	JJ	Honestly, there’s such good reviews for this company which is strange to me. The quality of the clothes aren’t really there in terms of the materials they use and the fits are so off. I ordered the pearl dress and got a medium which I couldn’t even get my arms in so exchanged this for a large. The large was huge and kept falling off of my shoulders. The company should really think about letting people leave reviews for products on their pages as well as having proper size charts for each product. Leaving two stars as I was able to exchange although the communication with the team is the slowest I’ve ever had. Don’t expect them to respond any time soon. The fees associated with returning things as well are so high. Not the greatest company to deal with in my opinion so I can’t understand how they have such glowing reviews. Maybe it’s the type of dress you order? I know they had issues with the pearl dress originally but they claimed to have fixed this? Not for the dress I ordered, wonder if they’re still selling the original stock for it.Updated to leave one star. The online portal lets you return things, however, when I had emailed the company, they responded very late (after I had already sent the items back) to say that I couldn't return the item. This is completely incorrect as there are trading laws in the UK that this company has to follow. It seems that a lot of people have experienced this in the black friday sales so don't be taken advantage off, they legally have to refund you if you return within 14 days. I will be waiting for my refund and tracking my item.

5576	oddmuselondon	Meg Roberts	Firstly I need to say everything I brought is stunning, the quality is beautiful and I feel incredible in it. I had to send three items back for a smaller size and it was so easy to do. I can say that all items brought are absolutely timeless and for anyone thinking about buying don’t even hesitate. It’s pricier than shops like Zara but it’s well worth it due to the quality and originality! Thank you to Aimee and the Odd Muse team.

5578	oddmuselondon	CF	The dresses are beautiful and the fabric is lovely, but I've had issues with returns/exchanges which has left me with a worrying experience. I ordered the square neck midi pearl dress but the arms were too tight so decided to return and get the next size up presuming it was my measurements that were off. I chose to exchange, and 10 days later received the new dress. The new dress was way too big, but as I went onto the returns portal to return the dress, it said I was due £0 back for the return. When I explored exchanging for a second dress, it credited me £50 less than the original amount I had paid. I've contacted customer service, but when I've previously contacted them it took 5 days for a response.The dresses are beautiful, and make sure you measure yourself properly before ordering - the returns/exchange system is concerning.	2024-12-10	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6759cd753af877515ea1d999	0.1506012506012506	neutral	["dress", "ive", "return", "dresses", "beautiful", "days", "new", "contacted", "fabric", "lovely"]
5579	oddmuselondon	Isobel Watson	I recently ordered a few dresses during Odd Muse’s Black Friday sale, excited to finally try out some items I had been eyeing for months. Unfortunately, the entire experience was extremely disappointing.The main issue was the lack of transparency regarding their sale policy. Nowhere during the purchasing process was it clearly communicated that sale items were non-refundable. For a high-end, luxury brand, this felt unreasonable and unfair. If I had known this upfront, I would not have made the purchase. To make matters worse, I noticed that the same particular item I bought is still being sold at the same price but now marked without the “final sale” tag, which means it could be returned if purchased now.When I reached out to customer service for assistance, I was met with poor support. It took a week to get a response, and when I did, I was simply directed to the terms and conditions. This response was neither helpful nor satisfactory, leaving me feeling ignored and undervalued as a customer.What’s even more troubling is that Odd Muse has been deleting and hiding comments on their social media pages from customers who are expressing the same complaints. This kind of censorship only adds to the sense that they’re not being honest or transparent with their customers.Adding to my frustration, I now have to pay £10 to return the items I can, which feels unreasonable and adds to the overall negative experience. I have never had such an unpleasant encounter with a brand, especially one that positions itself as luxury. I won’t be shopping online with Odd Muse again and would strongly caution others to think twice before purchasing, especially during sales.	2024-12-09	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6759cadc3f0272fee84c2c71	-0.019047619047619042	neutral	["sale", "odd", "muse", "items", "experience", "purchasing", "luxury", "brand", "unreasonable", "would"]
5580	oddmuselondon	Kirsty	Absolutely awful customer service. Items delayed by weeks with no apology or refund only to get a message days prior to new ‘shipment’ date to state it had been delayed another THREE weeks. Completely missing the event it was purchased for. Very expensive clothing for very poor service. No refund whatsoever for huge delay and missing the event the item was actually ordered for. Do not order if you’re planning this for an occasion as you won’t receive it in time or even in a timely manner.

5585	oddmuselondon	LISA	I love the Odd Muse brand and we buy lots of it, but I find the stock control very frustrating as often you order an item on pre-order and are told it will be despatched on X date but then gets delayed further. I am waiting for an order which I was told would be despatched on the 30th Nov when the order was placed, but is now delayed until 13th Dec. There were items on the order which were available, and I was happy to wait for all the order when it was due 30th Nov, but with the further delay I have missed the opportunity to wear the items to the events I purchased them for. I have emailed to ask for the other item in stock to be sent to me but my email has not been answered, and honestly it’s too late now, I just hope I get everything NDD from the 13th Dec.	2024-12-09	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/675978332752a225ef0a2c01	0.08179487179487178	neutral	["order", "stock", "item", "told", "despatched", "delayed", "30th", "nov", "13th", "dec"]

Firstly, it’s operating an illegal returns policy under distance selling regulations for final sale items, robbing its customers of refunds they are legally allowed to have. Challenge them on this quoting the regulations as they knew I knew my stuff and gave me a full refund. I see a lot of reviews say the same on here. You have a legal right to a refund. Secondly charging £9 for a return. Thirdly, they charged me a further £9 for parcel protection and told me I selected this at checkout, when I did not.If I could give minus stars for customer care I would. Will not be ordering again.

A little disappointing as I brought this for a Christmas present and would have liked the chance to order something else in time, but it's just one of them things. I haven't liked the material on any of the items ordered so far, although they seem durable and the dress designs are beautiful, they aren't nice to touch and feel cheap and grainy. I went into the store last week to save the back-and-forth with ordering online and found that the silk and other types of material are much nicer and feel better.	2024-11-27	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67569e4aa425baf627354aa0	0.17421875	neutral	["isnt", "arent", "given", "items", "went", "store", "liked", "material", "feel", "made"]

I ordered a black satin mini dress, and it is so pretty, You literally cant look ugly in a Oddmuse dress. I also own the black cap sleeve dress and just wore it on my birthday yesterday, I looked the best i have ever looked, i got so many compliments.

Online, I did the black friday sale, I knew it was non refundable but went with my usual sizing from last time for my items but had different fit this time. I did take both items to be tailored, one dress to get hemmed and the top to have the sides brought in. Overall, I love the quality of the garments, but these definitely require some tailoring if you want to get the ideal fit out of them.	2024-11-27	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/675666abb7c85789be642d19	0.2976190476190476	neutral	["one", "items", "person", "online", "time", "fit", "get", "two", "experiences", "experience"]

It’s something special and different which I love. So timeless and classic. I think this style never goes out of fashion. The only thing that is causing me issues are the sizes. M is too small and L is way too big. It seems I can’t find a size perfect for me.

5634	oddmuselondon	Neva	I’ve purchased 3 dresses and 1 shirt from Oddmuse, I can confirm that the quality and fit of the clothes is NOT the same as Shein. It is amazing, the way their clothes snatch me in at the waist and has a beautiful A-line silhouette, it gives me curves that I do not have and it hides my tummy insecurities. It allows me to eat as much as i want when I’m out with friends, without feeling insecure about being too bloated and uncomfortable in my outfit. Aimee has put so much thought into her designs, helping solve some of our insecurities as women when we put on a dress! The only con for me with Oddmuse, is that I am petite (5ft). Their midi dresses are more of a maxi on me, their mini dresses are a bit too long and almost hit me at the knee. Anything with sleeves is way too long for my arms. So I did have to get everything tailored and shorten. I will also say to size up for comfort. But my overall experience is very positive and I will continue to buy from Oddmuse!	2024-12-08	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6755aadafc09312a473e90ce	0.14780844155844156	neutral	["dresses", "oddmuse", "clothes", "way", "insecurities", "much", "put", "long", "purchased", "shirt"]

I won’t shop with them again and certainly don’t recommend them, you can get similar fits and styles from other companies out there with a nicer shopping experience and better aftercare, as unlike Odd Muse they care about their customers and have ensured they have a working and fair customer service and don’t sneakily change policies or push through shipments after you’ve asked to cancel so they can claim it’s no longer possible.

They take 4 days to reply to an email, so basically your issue will be solved in one month. They are growing business, getting a lot of customers, but their system is not capable of handling the steady growth. It seems like their main focus is to fool and attract customers through their marketing and appealing images, and have no care of the customer experience when buying and receiving the item. I am not saying not to buy from them, their products are amazing and elegant, but just to let everyone know there is a price u pay when buying their products and that is your mental health	2024-12-05	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6751ed3918894d29e1c899ac	0.17037037037037037	neutral	["buying", "experience", "marketing", "customer", "customers", "products", "poor", "spend", "much", "money"]

5663	oddmuselondon	Heather Halliday	The clothes are certainly nice BUT - be warned they excessively charge for returns. I was charged £30 for returning 3 dresses. This is unethical and I’m investigating whether it’s even legal. They charge £5 handling fee PER ITEM despite the parcel being one package and £5 postage PER ITEM despite again, it being one package. I am opening a dispute with my credit card company as I’m frankly appalled they treat customers this way. I kept 1 item too, I was just trying dresses for an event and returning what I didn’t need - very common practice with online ordering. Presumably you can return in store for free… so what happens if someone has a disability? Again; unethical. I also think sizing is completely off - a size 12 is a Large, 14 an XL - shame on this brand for labelling women as small medium or large. Why not just label 6,8,10 and so on? Will not be using again as matter of principal based on the above.	2024-12-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/674f695c00c8b6e81e6dc767	-0.03614285714285714	neutral	["item", "charge", "returning", "dresses", "unethical", "per", "despite", "one", "package", "large"]

5670	oddmuselondon	Marian Baca	My experience with odd muse has been excellent!!, I discovered the brand because I was tired of fast fashion where the clothes are less and less durable and the designs are only trendy, I was a little skeptical about ordering something since, honestly, it´s very rare I like some of what I order online, but on this occasion I was surprised that everything arrived of impressive quality, the fabrics are heavy and beautiful, personally I´m very particular with fabrics, and they fit the body perfectly, I´m very thin and the clothes are always too big for me, but this time everything looked perfect.I love their entire collection, it ´s classic and timeless, they are garments that make you feel elegant, demure, feminine, that you can wear a thousand times and you will always look incredible, I´m really in love with the brand, so much so that I have 2 orders in a very short time time haha ​​and I'm going for more, on my next trip to London I´ll definitely visit the store <3.In terms of shipping, everything is excellent, you only have to pay the import costs.

I do love their outfits but not sure their customer served is good and it should be if I have to spend a lot of money on one outfit and pay customs charges to the Netherlands	2024-07-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/674348cce565e1898d40948f	0.033333333333333326	neutral	["dress", "issue", "unfortunately", "ordered", "hemming", "bottom", "sent", "offmuse", "email", "even"]

5700	oddmuselondon	Babette Driessen	I visited the Odd muse store in London, which was a nice experience. The people who worked there were very nice and helpful. The quality of the clothes is explicitly and fit true to size. I only wish that the store were to have been a little bigger. Due to the size of the store there were only one to two changing rooms. Which meant that you had to stand in line for quite a bit to be able to try on the clothes. So you’re not really able to just take your time to try a few pieces on to see what you like best. It makes the experience a bit rushed in my opinion. I’m sure that when there is a higher demand for in store shopping that they will expand the store. Besides that everything was great!	2024-10-01	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6743320c8003ba335cbfe507	0.2618137254901961	neutral	["store", "nice", "experience", "clothes", "size", "bit", "able", "try", "visited", "odd"]

5705	oddmuselondon	Alexandra Croshaw	I bought the pearl dress for an event, I was so excited to wear it as it’s beautiful. However it’s the most uncomfortable and difficult thing to wear, the sleeves are too tight and do not stay on your shoulders. I lasted an hour then had to change. I ordered 2 different parcels of different sizes to get the best fit but still wasn’t right, and then having to return 3 parcels cost me £13.50 which is crazy! I spoke to Shane in customer service who was soooo helpful, really quick at responding and got the problem sorted right away. Very impressed with the customer service.	2024-11-21	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67403d05d3297a99d7ec6b9e	0.20674603174603176	neutral	["wear", "different", "parcels", "right", "customer", "service", "bought", "pearl", "dress", "event"]
5706	oddmuselondon	Carys Thomas	Extortionate return fee Hidden in their t&c’s is a £5 handling fee on top of the cost to get it delivered and refunded, totalling £13.45 which is extortionate. You wouldn’t get charged a handling fee at a shop where they have overheads and wages so why a postal return.  Be warned and spend your money with a clothing company who values your freedom to try clothes without losing out.	2024-11-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/674020a21c2c0a02d843f2a5	0.16666666666666669	neutral	["fee", "extortionate", "return", "handling", "get", "hidden", "top", "cost", "delivered", "refunded"]
5707	oddmuselondon	Olivia Wood	I went to the Soho location on opening day, but have previously shopped at their location in London. Because I’ve been in London (and have half of their clothes from every collection), I NEEDED to check out the NYC location! So I went on a four hour bus ride from DC to NYC to wake up early and wait in line for three hours in the cold. I wouldn’t do this and spend the money on a hotel and taxis and a bus if I didn’t LOVE this brand? It’s because I am in love with Odd Muse and the beautiful quality of the clothing, the way it hugs my curves perfectly, and the way it’s so flattering on every body type! As a college student, I have to be careful about spending money, but I’m a big supporter of spending money on good quality clothing that will last forever. Odd Muse is timeless. When I was in SoHo, I ended up buying the gold bow dress, the ultimate muse tailored mini skirt and top, the black short flowing skirt, and the Odd Muse brown sweater. (I own the collared white and black dress, the classic black short sleeve dress, and the long sleeve dress). I have been dying for the gold bow dress for the holiday season and I wore it for an event and got so many compliments. I love Odd Muse so much and Aimee is such an inspiration. She shows that fashion is elegant in simplicity and that you can be your most beautiful self by being confident in what you wear. She quite literally is the advocate for women everywhere and truly knows how to let us shine.	2024-11-09	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/673fe5c14425dc9ab7356bfb	0.17642857142857146	neutral	["muse", "dress", "odd", "location", "money", "love", "black", "went", "soho", "london"]

5715	oddmuselondon	Lena	The dresses look beautiful in the pictures, and based on the good reviews, I decided to order three. Living in Ireland, I’m always mindful of potential additional fees or taxes during the checkout process, but there was no mention of any.After placing my order, I received a payment request from DPD for over €200 in taxes and fees. I contacted customer service to highlight that other shops either integrate these costs or provide a clear warning during checkout. Unfortunately, their response referred me to their terms and conditions and confirmed that these taxes are non-refundable, even if the dresses don’t fit and need to be returned.I understand that every company has its own terms and conditions, but customers deserve a fair warning when entering their shipping address. Transparency is key to good customer service.	2024-11-16	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/673a1b00506132bd94f44dc5	0.31875000000000003	positive	["taxes", "dresses", "good", "order", "fees", "checkout", "customer", "service", "warning", "terms"]

5719	oddmuselondon	DG	I've gone straight in the middle with my rating as I have really mixed feelings about my experience with ordering from this brand, I have a jumper from them which is beautiful and that's a size 12 (L) which is a lovely oversize fit on me and its great quality. I decided to take the plunge and order a dress that I had my eye on for ages, the quality of the dress was incredible and that speaks for itself and I love the designs but as for the sizing, its absolutely crazy - I'm generally a 14 but can range from 12-16 depending on the item, material, style and desired fit etc, but probably wear an average of a 12-14 most of the time. I followed the size guide and I was measuring across 3 different sizes which made it quite tricky to know what to order but in the end I picked the biggest (which was a UK18 equivalent and I went for that due to the amount of feedback I was hearing about the sizing being small in the dresses and knowing I have more of a chest and that was the measurement I was coming out the biggest in when reviewing the size guide) as I figured I could probably have it taken in if needs be. I have to be honest it's been an expensive trial as in total with shipping and return fees etc it cost me almost £20 and I have nothing to show for it - the dress was absolutely huge on me around the hips, stomach and lower body area, which would have been impossible to take in without completely changing the shape of the dress, the arms fit fine but felt a little tight when I tried to move around too much - there would have been no hands in the air dancing vibes in this particular style, but as for the chest and zipping it was far too tight, I almost got it up but I wouldn't have been able to breathe. Maybe Odd muse could consider a two tier sizing where they offer smaller cup size and larger cup sizes of their dresses, as for me I definitely didn't need anything more than an XL from the hips down but it was clear that top half I needed more room. Further to this I picked up another dress from a resale site just out of curiosity as it was unworn, new with tags and that was an XL but in a different style with no arms, and again it fit absolutely perfect except being able to zip up over the chest so I really feel that a two tier chest sizing might be the way to go to prevent customers having so many returns as the return fees are extremely high, I understand businesses can't foot all costs and I would never expect my initial shipping to be refunded but to charge the levels of fees that are charged to try something on is crazy when their sizing is like it is. I would probably make a purchase from the brand again but only in items which the material is forgiving, however if they were to make their range a two tier chest size I'd be more likely to try dresses again as I think they're beautiful they just need to be a little more inclusive in terms of different body shapes as sadly not everyone has the same proportions.	2024-11-07	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/673751fc750dd85d28171515	0.17407934217458024	neutral	["size", "dress", "sizing", "chest", "fit", "would", "absolutely", "style", "probably", "different"]

5730	oddmuselondon	V G	£100+ for a polyester dress of on quality. It’s a bit much. I understand it’s a small business and it aims to reduce overconsumption and I respect that, but please please please use nicer material! I have ordered from them twice: First dress was the one with sleeves (cannot remember the name of it but it went viral a while back) I am quite small and slender but my arms are a tad thicker and it was so tight I could barely move them up and down and the material had no stretch to it. The return is  within 14 days, I ultimately missed the window and had to sell it online 2nd time I ordered a Dropped Hem Midi Dress, it was sort of ill fitting also, but specially around my chest, it also had 0 stretch to  it. The colour was cute (pale yellow) but the material was not very nice, not to mention the thread near the zipper on its way of getting undone. I did manage to get it and return within the 14 day window however it was not cheap (paid for delivery again, the whatever £6 swap project was non refundable) so ended up losing some money, even though the dress was just too ill fitting to me… I respect your mission a lot. I don’t mind the price too much, i would even pay more for it, if you please get a nicer, more natural fibre material or at least add some stretch to it so it fits more people…	2024-11-11	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6731db3ede2db3840bad29d4	0.05258320897209787	neutral	["dress", "please", "material", "stretch", "much", "small", "respect", "nicer", "ordered", "return"]

5736	oddmuselondon	Candice Bergst	Initially I was hesitant to purchase from Odd Muse as it was expensive and I wasn’t sure of the quality. When I opened the package, I was shocked about how amazing the quality of the material was and how beautiful my items were. There was a black mark on the dress I wasn’t able to get out so I contacted customer service. The reply was quick and the issue was resolved almost immediately. The individual I was in contact with was very apologetic and provided great customer service. If there would have been issues with replacing the item, I would not be purchasing more from OddMuse as receiving/sending items is a bit more difficult with being in the US. I will 100% be buying more items due to the quality of the material and customer service.	2024-11-05	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/672da2bc3d38a91648e8307b	0.1736111111111111	neutral	["quality", "items", "customer", "service", "material", "would", "initially", "hesitant", "purchase", "odd"]

5737	oddmuselondon	Consumer	I discovered Odd Muse through TikTok. I first ordered two sleeveless tops. The items were delivered quick and they fit amazing. Super high quality and classic. Items were true to size.  I love it so much that I couldn't resist and bought the halter top and a black midi skirt to match. They fit perfect and in my opinion it works for any occasion.  They can be on the pricier size, but Its 100% worth the money. Quality unmatched, no dupes can compare honestly. I am going to order more, cant wait for the next sale!	2024-10-31	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/672d24bdbe19b1055c612086	0.3294736842105263	positive	["items", "fit", "quality", "size", "discovered", "odd", "muse", "tiktok", "first", "ordered"]
5738	oddmuselondon	Francesca Long	I had the most fantastic experience with a recent order. I placed a very last minute order for a dress to wear to my 30th birthday party. Only one week in advance of the party and I needed shipping to Ireland as well. Firstly, the size guide on the website is very accurate and the dress fit so well. Secondly, I had emailed the customer service dept to see if there was anything they could do to speed up delivery. They assured me the dress had been packaged and sent to the courier right away and my fate was in their hands. I placed the order on Thursday evening and I had the dress in my hands by Tuesday afternoon!! I did have to pay customs as I was ordering to Republic of Ireland but it was so worth it for the best fitting, most snatching, prettiest dress! Thank you to the Odd Muse Gods that made this work out for me, so grateful for you all!	2024-10-25	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/672cf3d2ce74f75127da4bf1	0.31553968253968256	positive	["dress", "order", "placed", "party", "ireland", "well", "hands", "fantastic", "experience", "recent"]

5740	oddmuselondon	Eloise Pickervance	My overall experience was exceptional, it was my first time shopping and from the start of the process to receiving the item was so efficient and faultless. The dress I bought was the square neck midi in navy blue, I am 5"11 so struggle to find dresses which fit and it was unreal! The quality was like a Victoria Beckham dress! thick but not rigid and the navy blue was a dark navy so was perfect! I returned and bought an XS as I wanted it to be tight - I do have quite a large bust so usually I wouldn't be able to wear an XS but it fit like a glove.

5741	oddmuselondon	cliente	Unfortunately I didn’t look at the negative reviews and I should have before purchasing the dress online. The return policy is ridiculous. You can’t return in the shop, it has to be done online and they will charge you £4.5 return shipping fee and £5 handling fee. And some weird £6 of SWAAP protect at the purchase, which is not optional. Of course if you give up your return money, they will give you the full amount as a gift card. It left a bad taste, in 2024 online shopping should be more friendly. I admit the dresses are beautiful but for a piece of poliester and over a £100 order, I was expecting more.	2024-11-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/672b9593f2630d3b2711c4f7	0.021969696969697004	neutral	["return", "online", "fee", "give", "unfortunately", "look", "negative", "reviews", "purchasing", "dress"]

5753	oddmuselondon	Natalie	I wanted to love my experience with Odd Muse so badly but unfortunately found it lacking. I ordered from the new collection and unfortunately found that the style did not really suit me. As I don’t live near a store, ordering online was the only option really and I spent a long time considering whether I would make a purchase but finally went for it. With most brands, if you find that the item does not suit or the size isn’t quite right, you can return for free. Odd Muse charges customers for returns and subtracts this amount from the total amount to be refunded. In addition to this, at checkout I hadn’t realised that SWAP protect had been added automatically (it’s an opt-out). This amount will be not refunded. This meant that the experience of trying on a dress which wasn’t right for me has cost me £19.45 in total. I’d love to reorder from Odd Muse and try other styles on the run up to Christmas but unfortunately this experience, and the associated cost, has put me off.	2024-11-04	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6728dc8b2e10744c299d7193	-0.0012337662337662226	neutral	["experience", "odd", "muse", "unfortunately", "amount", "love", "found", "really", "suit", "right"]

5756	oddmuselondon	Rebecca Earl	I recently ordered a top for £51.95, which included delivery, but was extremely disappointed with the entire experience. The item was too small, and I needed a replacement quickly for an upcoming holiday. When I reached out to customer service, they advised that I should return the top and place a new order instead. However, they refused to honor my new customer discount on the replacement order, which was very frustrating.As a result, I decided to simply return the item, only to be refunded £36.02 – far less than what I originally paid. Customer service explained that this was due to return costs and handling fees, meaning I lost £15.93 just for trying on a top that didn’t fit. This feels unfair and unreasonable, especially when I followed their advice on how to handle the exchange. I’m very disappointed with the customer service and return policy and will think twice before ordering from this company again.	2024-10-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/672882f7d28e11ae99382373	0.01973304473304472	neutral	["customer", "return", "top", "service", "disappointed", "item", "replacement", "new", "order", "recently"]

5762	oddmuselondon	Consumer	When going to shop for my graduation dress in the London store the staff where impeccable, the staff where so lovely, evening though the shop was busy which is understandable as it was a Saturday and is a very poor place to shop, the staff always made you feel heard and tended to. I purchased the odd muse ultimate satin dress as a curvy girl this dress accentuated my curves and was stunning. On my graduation day wearing this dress for a while the only issue I found was the neckline started to gather together creating a circle neck instead of the straight neck. However I had had the dress on from 9:30am in the morning till 7:30pm so a very long time to wear a dress!

5767	oddmuselondon	B K	Ordered a dress to try, unfortunately with it being polyester the item was of bad quality (should have expected this) however the real issue stems from the returns policy. Just to order and return one item I have lost out on £13. £3.95 outgoing shipping cost (understandable), £4.50 return shipping cost and then a £5 “return handling fee” which is despicable. How can a company charge its customers to “handle” their return? Isn’t this what every company does in the world free of charge? This fee should only be charged should the garment actually BE damaged, not on every single normal return. Money making scam it seems. Not the best experience and doubt to ever be returning with these policies.	2024-10-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6722c3e8089b97f826a0ce46	0.03785714285714288	neutral	["return", "item", "shipping", "cost", "fee", "company", "charge", "every", "ordered", "dress"]

5781	oddmuselondon	Caitlin Potts	Such good quality! Originally ordered the pearl dress with the longer sleeves but had to return it and went for the spaghetti strap dress as I found it more bigger bust friendly. Saw a lot of conversations about the returns process but because I was fine to exchange, I thought it was smoother than I expected (although I can see how if you wanted a straight up refund it might be more complicated). Dress quality is second to none and the pearls are sewn on so well which I always worry about things like that falling off but that won’t be an issue here. Got a lot of compliments and because it’s an elevated basic, I already have several ideas of how I can style it so well worth investing in it. My only wish would be that there was more of a signal on the website about what is bigger bust friendly. I’m a 34GG and often have to size up for this, or have to try different styles and sizes, so if there was going to be a bigger bust range in the future that would be amazing!!!	2024-10-17	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/671e7171de14aacc82e52a9f	0.20942028985507247	neutral	["dress", "bigger", "bust", "quality", "friendly", "lot", "well", "would", "good", "originally"]

I used the size guide to pick the right size for me, and I must say it was spot on! Fits like a glove😅 I live in Denmark and it still only took a couple of days before it arrived with DHL.I was in contact with oddmuse costumer service during the weekend (where I had placed my order). After placing it, I received a discount code. I asked if it was possible to add the discount and within a few hours my order was cancelled and I could place a new order and now use the discount.

5787	oddmuselondon	REBECCA F	I was so excited to order this dress. To the point I paid an extortionate amount to get it shipped to NZ. The first red glad was the Shein style plastic bag the dress comes in….. The next is the fact that the dress is made of two different fabrics - both of which are very cheap. It just looks odd. My Mum used to make wedding dresses, so I know a thing or two about quality dresses. The next is the fit. It is horrendous to the point the entire dress will need to be altered (like every single seam) - and I rigorously measured myself before ordering as the sizing seemed so different to any other brand.The designs are beautiful, but the execution is shocking. Might as well buy for a fraction of the price at Shein…. Which I don’t condone at all. The whole point of paying a higher price point was to invest in a luxury item… this is not it.	2024-10-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/671b1ce7cc16050331384eaf	0.1101058201058201	neutral	["dress", "point", "next", "two", "different", "dresses", "price", "excited", "order", "paid"]
5788	oddmuselondon	Hannah Wheatley	Have been a customer of odd muse for years now. Their pieces are second to none. The designs themselves, the quality… I’m obsessed.If ever I’ve had an issue, the customer service has always been top tier. I recently lost a couple of buttons on my dress and Kresna, the customer service representative that dealt with me couldn’t have been more friendly or helpful. She was simply fantastic. Before ordering with odd muse for the first time I hesitated because for the me price point was more than I’d usually spend, but I have been well and truly converted! Quality over quantity! I now own around 15 odd muse pieces which are regular staples in my wardrobe and I’m yet to experience anything less than incredible service and quality from the brand. Love love love. Couldn’t recommend more.	2024-10-18	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/671abfcec6505c03b348079e	0.24838541666666666	neutral	["customer", "odd", "muse", "service", "love", "pieces", "quality", "years", "second", "none"]
5789	oddmuselondon	Schneider Steffi	Hugely expensive additional costs!The customer pays the outward shipping of EUR 35,- (will not be refunded), and the packaging costs, so called "SWAP Protect" of further 7.95 EUR (will not be refunded). But they sent my order just in a simple wrapping paper like H&M does. In Austria, you have to pay further taxes, in my case 87,- EUR (will not be refunded). The customer also pays the return shipping cost of another 35,- EUR. And because that is not enough, a handling fee of another 5.00 EUR is deducted from the refund amount. Of the 367.80 EUR I've actually paid, I get 166.70 EUR back = A loss of over 55%! Last but not least: Odd Muse needed several e-mails and five weeks for the refund. What a terrible experience.	2024-10-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/671a4c977689d0aef882c7f8	-0.12638888888888888	negative	["eur", "refunded", "customer", "pays", "shipping", "another", "refund", "hugely", "expensive", "additional"]

5797	oddmuselondon	Muir Mah	I'm interested in buying dresses from Odd Muse, but I've encountered some sizing issues. One dress fits well, but another in the same size doesn’t fit at all. While it fits around the waist, the top area is too tight or big . I'm unsure how to make the dress work for my body. The return fees and duties make sending it back not worthwhile, and getting it tailored would cost a quarter of the dress price. Their manufacture needs to fix the sizing and  match the sizing of aritzia or ralph lauren. It will increase the sales and girls like myself will shop more. Please do something about duty and tax with the return fees. They are so HIGH.	2024-10-21	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6717dc052bda635d6e29553d	0.11043290043290042	neutral	["sizing", "dress", "fits", "make", "return", "fees", "interested", "buying", "dresses", "odd"]
5798	oddmuselondon	Consumer	AVOID! They add lots of hidden costs. I ordered two dresses first of all they are far too small (I am usually a small or medium and a medium does not fit). They add “swap protect” without realising you have spent £9 on this. Then to return the dresses in total it has cost me £25! This is in the terms and conditions of course hidden in the small print but not clear when you check out. I have never known an online retailer to charge these fees. For a so called “ethical” brand this is so disappointing and immoral using innocent customers to cover their fees. Company don’t want to know when I complained about this they just sent the terms and conditions over which were on a link that is well hidden on their site.

5818	oddmuselondon	Sharleen S	If I could afford the whole collection then I would buy it in an instance. The classiest, most elegant items of clothing with impeccable quality allowing them to stand the test of time. My most recent purchases include the Ultimate Muse Knitted Jumper and the newest colourway of the Tweed Skirt (Size M).However, I do wish that there was a size chart on the website which correlates OMs sizing with UK sizing as I often have to over-order to find out what is the right fit. Overall, a brilliant standard of service all round. Just wish there were more retailers stocking OM in Scotland 😍😍	2024-10-10	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67082b2199b676e3f072761e	0.3096938775510204	positive	["size", "wish", "sizing", "could", "afford", "whole", "collection", "would", "buy", "instance"]

5822	oddmuselondon	jessica dunne	This is really frustrating because the dress quality is really nice but EXTREMELY undersized. I am a size 10uk in everything and I ordered a medium in the ultimate muse dress because I would normally order a s/m on other sites so when I read size up I thought that would be enough, it’s for a wedding next week. It won’t even zip past my ribs. I now have to get the dress altered to fit because I can’t return it because I will lose out on the €75 customs charge I got hit with. On top of the delivery charge which brought the dress to €204. So a €180 dress has now cost me over €300 by the time I can actually even wear it. Honestly, just not worth all this hassle and I was genuinely so excited. If you do order just take the huge customs into consideration and go much bigger sizing than you expect because this dress is M and is so small and has zero give in the top. The whole thing has me absolutely raging. It was already a splurge	2024-10-08	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67069d9c20a76d3006d430b3	0.12500000000000003	neutral	["dress", "really", "size", "would", "order", "even", "customs", "charge", "top", "frustrating"]

5825	oddmuselondon	Fatma Khalaf	I first heard about Oddmuse on TikTok and have been eyeing their products for a while. I decided to order the halter neck midi in white for graduation. It arrived perfect and quality is great. My only concern was the sizing. I spent A LONGGG time trying to decide what’s the right size for me. They have an xs and xl model but that is not inclusive as we are all different shapes and bodies. I ended up ordering the large based on the measurements in the website and it is a little too big in the bust and I will be altering the dress. I think this brand has something so unique but they really need to up their sizing and figuring out ways that can make it easier to shop	2024-10-08	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/670629a402ee6e56b90ddb6c	0.21826923076923077	neutral	["sizing", "first", "heard", "oddmuse", "tiktok", "eyeing", "products", "decided", "order", "halter"]

5831	oddmuselondon	Claire	Last year, I purchased the strapless dress, and ever since, I’ve been completely hooked on their designs. The quality, the fit—everything was perfect. However, living in the EU makes it almost unaffordable to keep ordering their clothes due to the high shipping and import fees. Despite that, I found an excuse two weeks ago to buy another dress for a special occasion. Once again, I was not disappointed.

5834	oddmuselondon	Sammy Gaber	I recently placed a fairly large order, but it was not indicated that customs and duty fees would apply. When my order arrived, I was charged €188 in customs and duty by DHL, which I paid. After trying on the clothes, I found that the dress was too big. I ordered a size small for everything and generally don’t have issues with sizing.When I requested a return, I saw a few options on the website, where I either had to pay upfront or take responsibility for returning the items myself. I chose DHL because of its convenience and location in Malta. After paying, I was notified of an issue with generating the returns label, which would be emailed separately. Two days later, I received a label for UPS, not DHL. We only have one UPS branch in Malta, with limited hours that aren’t convenient for my schedule, as they don’t operate on Saturdays. Due to work, I can’t take time off for this.I've been emailing Odd Muse frequently and, unfortunately, this has eroded my confidence in the process. I was also informed that I’d need to pay taxes and duties for an exchange. Given these issues, I’d prefer a refund for the return I paid for. I’ll take the dress to a tailor instead and won’t be placing another order. I have yet to receive any email or refund regarding the return postage.	2024-09-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6703d15e3581d3fddbf8842a	-0.07298534798534798	neutral	["order", "dhl", "return", "take", "customs", "duty", "would", "paid", "dress", "issues"]

5843	oddmuselondon	Car	I love the style and brand but in my recent order I had to return to get a bigger size. due to the sizing being very off. I'm a very petite curvy girl 5'0 with 30 waist and a fuller bust. I ordered 3 dresses in XXL 1 out of the 2 fit. The Two dresses that didn't fit had a button-up style that was made for smaller chests and flattened my chest to a point where it wasn't flattering it just feels like it only fits model sizes the bust was too small for my fuller chest but fit my waist but my arms were too big.  the dress that did fit still flattened my chest bit not as bad as the button up one. When I returned I got a larger size that fits better on my bust but my waist and arms are just too big and the length is too long for me being a petite 5'0. I do think they have potential, and they need to have real curvy petite sizes available. I don't want to spend over $150 on a dress to end up getting alterations that are just too much.	2024-09-25	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66fdcd1eacaa6b97038a3c62	0.11630434782608695	neutral	["fit", "petite", "waist", "bust", "chest", "style", "size", "curvy", "fuller", "dresses"]

I really think that the fabric is great quality because it doesn’t make me feel itchy since I have sensitive skin, but you can also obviously feel how well the material is as well, sensitive or not.

I never even return clothes when they don’t fit because I am THAT shy.However, this is literally the most amazing piece of clothing I have ever put on my body. It fits like it was MADE for me. I have never felt so confident and beautiful and I simply NEEDED to send an email with a good review. It is like it is sent from heaven itself and when I wore it with HEELS… girl I was unstoppable. I will never stop raving about this dress and I live in BETHLEHEM PA I don’t even have anywhere to wear it but good lord will I FIND somewhere to wear it.

Ordered two dresses, which were returned to Oddmuse via the courier, given the extreme customs charges I opted to return and not pay the customs as they were nearly as much as the dresses. I emailed oddmuse immediately to inform them of my decision and request a refund. They responded saying there would be an amount deducted from my refund despite never having recieved the items. I did not recieve the refund, but a statement saying I would be refunded minus approximately 50 euro of the total I paid. It is now a month later and I still have not recieved the refund despite having reached out their customer service team a total of 4 times.

But the jumpsuit fit in my normal size and I lost count of the amount of compliments I received while wearing it.

5908	oddmuselondon	AP	I had a terrible experience with this company. They deducted $100 from my refund and charged me $25 to return a dress that I carefully TRIED ON only once. The original tags and packaging were intact, yet they refused to accept the return. Their practices feel unfair and potentially illegal. The dress I ordered was $250, plus $20 for shipping, and despite returning it in perfect condition, they deducted $100 without explanation. The dress looked great in photos on their website but had an awful fit. I strongly advise against ordering from them – it's a waste of money!	2024-09-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66df1257447143e0c1c7e4a4	-0.02847222222222222	neutral	["dress", "deducted", "100", "return", "terrible", "experience", "company", "refund", "charged", "carefully"]

5911	oddmuselondon	Julianna	I recently had a query regarding an order which had not shipped as expected due to the pre order date changing. When I inquired about the delay Kresna Austria provided exceptional customer service and helped resolve the issue. She clearly outlined the reason for the delay and gave an honest and transparent timeline for expected dispatch which I really appreciated as I was ordering dresses for an upcoming event. I decided to cancel the order and re order a different dress which she promptly and seamlessly facilitated. I was incredibly impressed with the quick response ( bright an early in the morning - which allowed me to sort the issue before my working day!) , the tranparency regarding the issue and Kresna's ability to provide and execute resolutions which suited my situation. Above all else, Kresna was a delight to deal with and was friendly, attentive and understanding of the issue.

The fit is like nothing else and the quality is immaculate.I was however disappointed with the quality of the lime green skirt and halter top.

5925	oddmuselondon	Beth Forrest	I was beyond excited to order from odd muse for the first time, only to bitterly be let down. I ordered the Ultimate Muse Cap Sleeve Mini Dress for my graduation, and returned this dress due to it not suiting my figure. I received an email yesterday with a blurry picture attach suggesting that I have marked the dress and it has been worn (despite having tags on). Instead of receiving a refund to my bank card, they offered a full refund on a gift card voucher to then spend back on the store!! Absolutely shocking. With the cost of living crisis, some people desperately rely on this money. I will never order from odd muse again with this shocking customer service. I don’t think they care about their customers, and instead it is all about profits. I have had to dispute this with my bank as they are yet to reply to my email.	2024-09-04	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66d867ad6fa3a42c385c09bb	-0.14925925925925926	negative	["muse", "dress", "order", "odd", "email", "instead", "refund", "bank", "card", "shocking"]
5926	oddmuselondon	Alice Cotton	Was really disappointed in my experience in the Odd Muse London store at the beginning of August. I had read multiple reviews highlighting the inconsistent sizing so decided to go to store to try on a few items on my wishlist. The set up in the store was so disorganised, the queue for the two changing rooms takes up most of the store making it really cramped and hard to browse, if you want specific pieces from older collections you have to ask the staff to get them for you and they’re given to you in a plastic bag, making it difficult to have a good look/feel of the item if you don’t want to try on.I’m a bigger girl, size 14-16. I tried on the tennis dress in a 3XL and it would not zip on me. I was mortified and so upset. The sizing doesn’t seem to follow any guidelines and varies massively between styles. I handed the dress back to one of the staff members working who was so lovely to me and could clearly tell I was feeling bad about myself. I didn’t catch her name but I think she was quite new. She was so kind and considerate and friendly and she really positively affected my experience that day. I was disappointed to hear a clearly more senior member of staff talk to this lovely girl in a very degrading and rude way while I was shopping in store. I love odd muse as a brand, but I won’t be able to shop there until the brand becomes more mid/plus size friendly, in their sizing & their marketing.	2024-08-03	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66d818e719a8645bda1dfa17	0.08888074291300097	neutral	["store", "really", "sizing", "staff", "disappointed", "experience", "odd", "muse", "try", "making"]

5951	oddmuselondon	Miss Valentino	I wouldn’t recommend shopping at odd muse. I’ve ordered online & to my shock I was sent an incorrect item - baring in mind that they market themselves as a ‘luxury’ brand I was shocked by how the customer services has treated me and refused to refund - only resend the item I have ordered in exchange for me returning the incorrect item. Extremely rude and clearly working in breach of the consumer law - I suggest that IF anyone has a similar issue with odd muse - please escalate it under section 75 of consumer law. They operate based on the assumption that they can send out goods you have not purchased and twist the narrative as if the customer is at fault. Awful customer service.	2024-08-26	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66cdb091c2f0eacb27f163cc	-0.2791666666666667	negative	["item", "customer", "odd", "muse", "ordered", "incorrect", "consumer", "law", "recommend", "shopping"]
5952	oddmuselondon	Victoria D	It was my first time ordering from the The Odd Muse. I’d mired their dresses for months but didn’t know if it was worth the price tag. It absolutely is! I bought the ultimate pearl white dress and have never felt more beautiful.I would suggest sizing up. I’m a 14 and found the sleeves on the L a little tight but the XL fits perfectly.

5954	oddmuselondon	Irene	I'm truly amazed by this brand. I've been searching for a long time for a cute dress for my civil wedding. I tried different dresses from many other online stores and retailers, spanning various price ranges. When I visited the flagship store in London, the staff was really nice and helpful. I was so happy that the dresses looked just as they did on Instagram, even in real life. From the fabric to the design and fit, I was really impressed by the high-quality craftsmanship and fair pricing. It's always difficult for me to find great fits since I'm petite but busty with a small waist, but their dresses looked stunning on me. I bought three white dresses (Exclusive Muse No. 1, The Ultimate Muse Structured Mini Dress, and The Ultimate Muse Embellished Midi Dress), and I'm really in love with them. I will definitely order more and can highly recommend this brand to any bride-to-be or anyone looking for a feminine and sexy outfit for other occasions.	2024-08-09	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66cb116a550d050ad201b5c4	0.26439999999999997	neutral	["dresses", "dress", "really", "muse", "brand", "looked", "ultimate", "truly", "amazed", "ive"]
5955	oddmuselondon	Alex	I'm honestly shocked at the good reviews and can't help but think they are paid for.The designs look lovely on social media but the fit is impossible. As someone who orders all her clothes online, this is the first store that every outfit is a completely different size and fit, even the same skirt of just a different color. The returns portal and customer service sets you up to fail. I have over $400 in clothes that do not fit because they continuosly make you pay for labels that do not work. I have paid over $60 in labels, on top of my purchase, and can not return anything. When I emailed, I was given a very AI type response that did not solve anything.I have never been so dissapointed in a brand or clothing shop experience.	2024-08-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c9f820af961be2dc88c7f2	0.061111111111111116	neutral	["fit", "paid", "clothes", "different", "labels", "honestly", "shocked", "good", "reviews", "cant"]
5956	oddmuselondon	Claire	I ordered a dress, but the size was not as expected. The sleeves were too tight and the shoulders kept slipping off.

The quality speaks for itself 👏Delivery was on time (within a couple of days) and returning the other 2 dresses was a seamless process.

5959	oddmuselondon	Charlotte Martin	I really love the designs and colours, I think OddMuse is a brand that is paving the way for other brands - showing that simple, structured and quality items can be worn multiple times for many occasions (as they should!).I selected standard delivery and my order arrived next day, which was excellent.I do agree with another reviewer that I am still quite unsure of my sizing in items, Medium doesn't quite fit me but Small is too small (UK10). Regardless, I find myself glued to their socials eagerly awaiting their next launch (which is consequentially my birthday!).In future I'd love the option to return items bought online instore as this way I would hopefully be able to swap for the correct size.	2024-08-01	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c6f7385c6f6c80f38bc0da	0.12678571428571428	neutral	["items", "love", "way", "next", "quite", "small", "really", "designs", "colours", "think"]
5960	oddmuselondon	GinaK	As an EU buyer, this was the most expensive fitting ever! Ordered the midi dress in xs, which is my usual size, paid 100 EUR of shipping and customs for the dress to arrive. Dress is so so small around the waist, have no choice but to send back which is costing another 13€. I basically paid over 110€ just to try on a dress that is basically made for the very happy few with tiny waists. Weirdest sizing ever, shame because in itself the dress looks pretty. Never again for me unfortunately.	2024-08-21	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c5e79a21d947f23ca581a9	0.06136363636363637	neutral	["dress", "ever", "paid", "basically", "buyer", "expensive", "fitting", "ordered", "midi", "usual"]
5961	oddmuselondon	Michelle H	This brand has such a good sense of how to create beautiful shapes with their dresses. The designs are simple, elegant, and chic. The craftsmanship (stitching, weight of materials) seems to be quite a bit better than comparably priced dresses I’ve found. And though things are often out of stock, they refill regularly and I’ve been impressed with how quickly I got the items I ordered. As an American, the return policy is a bit of a bummer (no international returns) and you have to pay attention to the size chart because the s/m/l runs a bit smaller than many US based brands (but it has been pretty true to the inches listed).	2024-08-20	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c5062b80dcfd3f0de5a10d	0.33222222222222214	positive	["bit", "dresses", "brand", "good", "sense", "create", "beautiful", "shapes", "designs", "simple"]
5962	oddmuselondon	Fiona	I ordered my black midi dress on pre-order and it had a dispatch date in August. I happened to check the website close to that date and noticed the dispatch date had been updated to September. I emailed the customer service team to check if my dress was still due to arrive in August and had a reply the same day to say my dress was already on its way! It arrived the next morning and I love it - the fit is so flattering with the wide placement of the straps, it’s brilliant quality and the skirt hangs beautifully.

5965	oddmuselondon	Amy	I feel really let down by the process, which for me far outweighs the quality of the product. They're new returns portal is seemingly set up to purposefully make it hard to returns items. There is no address or steps for return, ob the order slip, when you submit on the actual portal or in the follow up email confirming return. When I emailed, I was just directed to the portal - which is about as useful as the returns portal itself.I had an item on pre-order but they have no branded communications to say your order is on the way, delays were not communicated- instead they opted to quietly update the small print on the site. Transparency is everything and this brand lacks it. I feel really let down by the ordering process and their thinly veiled attempt to avoid returns.	2024-08-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c30994e3ab44558e522ebe	-0.02636784511784512	neutral	["returns", "portal", "feel", "really", "let", "process", "return", "order", "far", "outweighs"]

5977	oddmuselondon	Maxime	Ok, so listen: I'm obsessed with the stuff this brand puts out because it fits me so well. I have never in my life found a brand that fits my body so perfectly and flatteringly. I had bought a blazer from them in 2020, and eyed a pearl dress, but wanted to try it on before taking the plunge and spending the cash. As they are in a few stores in Britain, I tried it while visiting Edinburgh. Game changer. Since, I've bought 4 of their dresses and another blazer. Super versatile, and also comfortable despite being polyester (not a fan, except w odd muse). I suspect they use the same or a derived pattern to make their tops/top parts of their dresses because everything I've tried fits in the same beautiful way. I will say however, I also tried on their trousers and a midi dress, and they are LONG. As a 159cm girly, those are not for me. I'll stick to the minis. Have never had an issue with the shipping and handling, always went smoothly. Therefore I recommend this brand!	2024-08-15	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66bda686306a8ba9439627c5	0.17435897435897435	neutral	["brand", "fits", "tried", "never", "bought", "blazer", "dress", "ive", "dresses", "also"]

5979	oddmuselondon	Ma Ria	The dress is of good quality, but unfortunately the sizing is inconsistent and runs large.The most disappointing aspect, however, is the extra costs for delivery and returns. For a dress priced at £165, an additional £4 for shipping and another £4.50 for returns is unreasonable. These extra charges are a significant drawback and have unfortunately lost you a customer. It’s frustrating that ordering / returning a dress could cost an additional £10, which makes me hesitant to order again in the future due to these unnecessary costs.	2024-08-12	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66bb3a4360b94cce0e855769	-0.07916666666666668	neutral	["dress", "unfortunately", "extra", "costs", "returns", "additional", "good", "quality", "sizing", "inconsistent"]

5993	oddmuselondon	Amii Perry	Recently purchased from the new range to wear for my birthday, I live in Australia and was worried about the sizing, so I ordered a Small to be sure it would fit, I am a size aus 6 so this dress should have been a little big. I was charged $70aus for shipping, the dress arrived and didn't fit( I work in retail and in my opinion Distress was made as a small size six) I then had to pay $70 to return the dress and can only have a store credit. So if I want to purchase the dress again. I would have paid a total of $210 in shipping fees. Customer service was unhelpful.

I received the dress in an awful paper bag, even though I paid EXTRA 100 euros, sorry this is not a luxury treatment for a luxury brand.	2024-08-07	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66b38cd4ba06f5d634cf2e15	0.01333333333333333	neutral	["dress", "decent", "thing", "euros", "extra", "luxury", "first", "bit", "overpriced", "beautiful"]

6004	oddmuselondon	Amy	Update: Dress is really nice and the material is so thick and slimming, as a size 10/12 I really appreciate that. Wouldn't order again due to customs charges but at least it was worth it 😅Ordered the Ultimate Muse dress for €155 and paid €14.95 for delivery. This I was happy to pay. I had read reviews saying that there was customs charges into Ireland and that people had paid between €16-€35. I decided that I would be okay with this as I wanted the dress for my graduation. Then today I get an email with a €71 charge for customs for the dress. I am honestly shocked and really disappointed at how expensive this was and I think other people need to know. I know this isn't really down to Odd Muse as a brand but I find it quite extortionate to be paying €71 for something to come from the UK to Dublin. I actually initially thought it had to be a scam since other people were charged so little previously. I would've liked to have known how expensive it would be before making the purchase. Dress hasn't arrived yet but I have really high hopes as I'm scared I'll have to pay customs to return it! The dress has now cost me €240 euro, €85 of that just to deliver it😅.	2024-08-07	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66b30a4a28a26aeadacfa0b6	-0.040972222222222215	neutral	["dress", "really", "customs", "people", "charges", "muse", "paid", "pay", "would", "\\u20ac71"]

They were able to advise me on sizing and made the shopping experience very easy. After trying on a few different sizes I bought the jumpsuit.A few days after my visit I also purchased one of the classic blazers online. I was hesitant to purchase without trying it on because I am normally between two sizes, but the size I chose based on the advice of the stylist I spoke to in store turned out to be perfect. I do think the pieces are a little expensive but are good quality.

I was very impressed with the quick, honest, and helpful service, which I have never experienced before.I think I will continue to order many dresses from you, as they look perfect, and I also believe the quality is excellent.

6038	oddmuselondon	Nicole Juxon-Parchment	The best and worst thing about Odd Muse is that you can almost never find sold out items on resale websites like eBay, Vinted and Depop.

6039	oddmuselondon	Jessica	I followed Aimee and Oddmuse on socials for so long and have always loved her classy designs. I had always hesitated ordering due to the cost of shipping in the event I had to return it from the States. But when the exclusive muse no 1 came back (which I had been stalking for months) I knew I just had to risk it. Shipping was super fast and i think I had it in just about a week. Once i got it I have never been so enamored by a dress, the quality and the fit of this dress was unreal. I also ordered the cap sleeve top and its become one of my favorite closet staples. Everything is fairly true to size so no need to bother with returns. If you're bigger chested just expect a little squeeze but it totally snatches you. So if you're unsure, it is so so so worth it.	2024-07-04	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/669e876606a369698df91451	0.20138888888888887	neutral	["always", "shipping", "dress", "youre", "followed", "aimee", "oddmuse", "socials", "long", "loved"]

6041	oddmuselondon	C C	Fast shipping. The pre-order times aren't fixed fyi, it does move. One of my dresses pre-order date got shifted but they were kind enough to compensate me with a voucher. Just a tip it would be better to inform your customers it’s been moved rather than us having to ask about it. Quality of the dresses are amazing. I do agree with the other reviews that the sizing is inconsistent, they really should aim to fix this (perhaps with an actual test group) and expand their sizing range. The returns and exchange process is relatively good, my dress was shipped back to me in about 4 working days after they received my return. However for the returns & refund, I am still waiting on my money. It’s been about 7 working days, so we’ll see how long they take. (Current timeline is 10 working days).Update: They’ve refunded me!

6049	oddmuselondon	George Forrest	I recently had a very disappointing experience with Oddmuse's customer service. I ordered a dress from them just two minutes after it was released, as it was meant for my wedding day. Given the significance of the occasion, I made sure to order as soon as the dress was available on their site.However, I did not receive a dispatch notice after several days. When I emailed them for an update, they responded that I had pre-ordered the item because it was out of stock. How could it possibly be out of stock within two minutes of ordering?Throughout the process, I had to constantly chase them for updates on my order. The lack of proactive communication and poor customer service was incredibly frustrating. It's a shame because the quality of their products looked very promising, and I was eager to purchase more items from them. Unfortunately, due to this terrible service, I won't be ordering from Oddmuse again.	2024-07-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/669a8d1f7170b907dff0a725	-0.08038461538461537	neutral	["service", "customer", "dress", "two", "minutes", "order", "stock", "recently", "disappointing", "experience"]

6061	oddmuselondon	Fiona	Dishonest company and awful cancellation policy. This company is pretending it can sell overseas after Brexit and cheating customers. The dress on the website is €165. In the store it is €165.  They didn’t have my size so I ordered it on line.  Within half a day I had a demand to pay an additional €70 for VAT.  I went to cancel and the company would not let me.  Told me I would have to “Initiate returns”.   And be charged delivery both ways. €30!   In the shop the dress is €165 including all the VAT and taxes.  How can they be charging on line the same amount?  The invoice on-line shows taxes at zero so they are profiteering off on-line customers. It’s a swizz and if you try to return /cancel you are snookered. If you ask for help you are quoted the “policy” which is hidden on the website.  If the item arrives faulty or doesn’t fit you will have paid the duty and the shipping and get neither back.   Don’t do it.   They have  not got their act together.  Hilariously their policy blames the “new EU charges”.  It’s like a little mini -Brexit amnesia that you pay for.

6073	oddmuselondon	Sey	I ordered two dresses and both were faulty. The first was a short structured mini and had a mark on the inside of the white dress. The second was the long maxi that recently came out, it was made of poor quality unlike the pictures you could see 2 circle pads at the chest area.I’m so disappointed as both times I’ve had to go through returning the dresses and I wanted them for my holiday. It’s unfortunate as I was so excited to buy pieces from the brand as I loved their mission of creating timeless pieces.	2024-07-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/668c5f1cbc8b3ee8c00a8776	-0.03409090909090909	neutral	["dresses", "pieces", "ordered", "two", "faulty", "first", "short", "structured", "mini", "mark"]

6086	oddmuselondon	Katherine	Top quality clothing and brand!! If you want to invest in your wardrobe and have timeless pieces you can style in a hundred different ways, Odd Muse is the way to go. I’ve ordered so many pieces from them and the quality is always consistently amazing. I was always so frustrated shopping brands like Zara, ASOS, etc where I would pay a lot for an item only for it to last one season (or less). Also, the items they stock are based on trends (which is fine but becomes costly over time). I seriously love Odd Muse and would recommend them to every woman in my life! :)	2024-07-07	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/668a8cc9a2dcc005594f754d	0.15817307692307694	neutral	["quality", "pieces", "odd", "muse", "always", "would", "top", "clothing", "brand", "want"]

I also used the website for an order which was quick and easy (loved the top I got!!). Sizing in both cases was true to size and aligned with the online size chart. The help services to check stock and ask questions were great - everyone I interacted with was super helpful and very quick to respond.

6091	oddmuselondon	Taylor	I bought a few items including the infamous blazer (which sadly is being returned) and my experience overall was lovely! I’m located in the USA, items arrived very quickly (within a week) I purchased package protection, not sure if that makes any difference. Both the blazer and the dress I purchased were very nice quality, I just wish the sizing was more inclusive. I struggled to find the right size even with the size chart and taking measurements, resorting in hours of looking through reviews. I went with a size Large for both items, a size up from the suggested measurements on the website. As I’m 5’1” my torso is quite short, my natural hip sits higher than where the waist cinches for most the products made by ODDMUSE - which is why the blazer is being returned. I’d love to see a petite & tall version made. The return process was easy, however this is the only company I’ve ever had to pay return postage for which is a little silly In my opinion. For the cost of the products and the uncertainty in sizing perhaps this can be made a free feature in the future.	2024-07-05	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6688b92a4a5a4f675b8e4dc5	0.13109848484848485	neutral	["size", "items", "blazer", "made", "returned", "purchased", "sizing", "measurements", "products", "return"]

6094	oddmuselondon	Lilly	I really was reluctant about writing this review as I wouldn’t want to put a business down and I’m all for giving good reviews out. However, the items I received are not the best quality. Especially for the price range I shouldn’t expect threads coming out and the sizing to be so off. It’s almost like there is no quality check. I’m honesty really disappointed. But lovely design, not for the bigger girls but for slimmer girls. As someone who invests in good quality timeless clothes, I thought I found a gem brand but I won’t be returning.

6095	oddmuselondon	Consumer	Love Odd Muse and love the story of the brand, but just beware Irish customers  the prices charged on the website are excluding VAT at 23per cent on top of the 20 percent UK VAT already included in the price. Prices are also excluding a hefty delivery charge that is not added  on until check out.  Between the VAT , customs and delivery I have paid 100euros, close to 50 percent extra on the order .

6096	oddmuselondon	Anna S	Terrible service. I ordered 2 dresses from the latest collection at exactly 9am when they launched. Got an order confirmation then heard nothing. Contacted them via email and nothing back. Got in touch via the website after 6 days to be told the warehouse team had messed up and not sent orders chronologically. There’s now no stock left to fulfil my order and I’ll have to wait until 23rd July (almost a month later) to receive my order. Asked for a refund which they’ve said they will do but guessing they were just planning to keep hold of my £270 and not provide any updates on the status of my order.

6139	oddmuselondon	Harriet Mercer	Amazing designs, fit can be inconsistent - but when it works it WORKS I have a couple of Odd Muse pieces - a blazer which I adore, 2x pairs of shorts I wear day to day, and a dress which I never fail to get compliments in. I'm obsessed with the brand and ethos, but I'm very hesitant to order online as I find the fit can really vary piece to piece (eg: I'm a S in the shorts but quite a few dresses I'm a M despite being flat chested).

My favourite collection is simple statements because they r so beautiful and versatile and can be dressed up or down daily.

I’ve been wanting an OM dress for the longest time but was always on the fence because the sizing is different and they don’t currently exchange/refund US orders. I’m 5’6” and an athletic build with large hips and typically wear a 6, 8, or size medium in US sizes. I ordered a Large in 2 different dresses from the resort collection and they both are perfect!! The halter part needs a small alteration as it’s slightly too big, but that’s normal for me as I am not blessed in the chest. The dresses came way quicker than I anticipated, even on a preorder, and are great materials. These are not Amazon or fast-fashion prices, but the fabric is so good and definitely worth the money.	2024-06-07	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6670b4767820f96b17bd1bd1	0.18634920634920635	neutral	["fence", "different", "large", "dresses", "ordering", "especially", "let", "encourage", "add", "cart"]

They also have incredibly fast shipping and good packaging with an extra bag on the inside that protects the clothes from possible damage. Their customer service is also fast, understanding and helpful 😊 The only thing that prevents me from buying every single garment from the website is the expensive shipping, VAT and customs fees that add up when I order home to Sweden🥺 But I’m just a girl and I will continue spending all my money on this beautiful brand.

6189	oddmuselondon	Chloe	I have purchased two Odd Muse dresses and the quality is second to none. The construction and fabrication in these dresses are far superior to brands charging double the price. With that being said, I've had both of them altered as I find the sizing to be off. The shoulder straps on one dress were far too long and the waist on another felt like two sizes too big. The alterations will cost me another dress! But overall, worth it.Secondly, their shipping is very fast, but $25 to the US.

6207	oddmuselondon	Rebekah Marquez	I always get so many compliments whenever I wear all my pieces! They are so adorable and stand out from the crowd. The only issues I have are that the fabric snags easily and doesn’t always feel as high quality as it should for the price. My other issue is sizing. Make sure to really pay attention to that on every single item. Just because you are a small everywhere else and even in some of the OM pieces, you could be an XXS or XS in other pieces. The sizing can be very strange compared to everywhere else I have shopped. The return process is also a huge pain so really pay attention to avoid all those issues.The adorable, classy, timeless pieces make up for the negatives that can be a huge bummer.

6214	oddmuselondon	Lora N	I love their clothes however I understand they are playing a marketing strategy and don’t want to over produce items but trying to buy something has become more of a hassle than an enjoyable experience. I have a wedding next week and it’s been months looking online everyday and nothing seems to restock which is a shame as for moments like this people buy. You do into the store and its bare and the items that are there the queue is crazy. I know they are doing well but its sad it really makes people turn away sometimes. I really hope they resolve this because I love everything they have.	2024-06-17	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66703a38d906f4593cbba9b8	0.10454545454545455	neutral	["love", "items", "buy", "people", "really", "clothes", "however", "understand", "playing", "marketing"]

6219	oddmuselondon	Victoria	There are no amount of words to express how obsessed I am with this brand. With every new collection launch there’s always something I find myself having to buy. Aimee and the Odd Muse team truly are fantastic and go out of their way to make sure the customer leaves happy.My first experience with Odd Muse that won my heart is that their customer service is extremely attentive. My first piece was the black cap sleeve. Unfortunately I bought the wrong size and needed to exchange and the team happily helped me. Then once I received my new piece the first time I wore it, the zipper got stuck and I inevitably had to have the zipper broken. When I reached out to the team again, I was so scared and nervous that I wouldn’t be given a chance at an exchange or refund or some kind of help. But instead I was given several options and in the end found one that was best suited for me. Because of this I have become a regular customer and now am eagerly awaiting the launch of resort 2.0.I’m in love with the quality of Odd Muse and how unique their footprint in the fashion industry is. I find that the pieces are very flattering and inclusive for even those who are on the curvier side. Couldn’t be happier. From the moment you’re viewing Odd Muse’s social media to the moment the product reaches your door, I truly do think they do a wonderful job at engaging their audience/ customers and providing luxury pieces.If you haven’t tried Odd Muse you’re missing out and definitely should give them a chance.	2024-05-24	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/667038849a085268dcb5abd4	0.12909564393939393	neutral	["odd", "muse", "team", "customer", "first", "new", "launch", "find", "truly", "piece"]

I ordered one more dress for my rehearsal dinner in size XS but that dress was too small. I would 1000% recommend Odd Muse. The dresses are amazing quality and so flattering.

6251	oddmuselondon	Katharina	Oddmuse's design and fabrics are timeless, high-quality and chic. I already own many dresses and a few tops and skirts from this brand. The quality is great and I love wearing the clothes. With the customer service I am unfortunately not satisfied. The seizing of one top turned out differently to the same model in a different colour and a blazer was two sizes too big for me compared to my normal Oddmuse size. I've been already waiting five weeks for a response to my emails, reminders and Instagram messages for an exchange/return/problem resolution from the customer service. It got to the point where I had to involve the founder Aimee, who replied very quickly and passed the case on to her team again. Unfortunately, I haven't heard back yet. Shipping to Germany is fast but expensive as you have to pay high customs fees due to Brexit and not having an EU warehouse yet. I continue to love Oddmuse's products, the founder's insights and her social media strategy. As a growing company, I imagine it's hard to provide good customer service, but this is something that should continue to be improved as the designs and products are perfect! So it shouldn't fail because of not enough staff at customer service while the sales are rising.	2024-06-17	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66702bb0e581f9c8d7a14894	0.1426923076923077	neutral	["customer", "service", "oddmuses", "already", "love", "unfortunately", "yet", "continue", "products", "design"]

I did think the area that goes from chest into armpit (?) could have done with slight tweaking but apart from that it’s incredible and I can’t wait to wear it again.

I’m sure this may have just been a busy day and was probably just an off moment for them, but it did make it quite awkward and not something I would associate with a luxury brand.	2024-06-11	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6670243b5e9e81c3fc30e206	0.21000000000000002	neutral	["brand", "one", "people", "love", "clothing", "service", "received", "girl", "processed", "sale"]

6306	oddmuselondon	Caitlin O'Neill	I have been obsessed with Odd Muse for a while now and follow the brand on socials religiously. They have converted me from buying bulk, cheap clothes - to investing in their quality items. I love when they drop a collection and then I treat myself to one item from there. The most recent was the Tennis Dress | Navy from Resort. Slightly less dressy from their usual clothing, I know this will be my go to day dress this summer! It is gorgeous and the quality is unmatched. I always purchase a large as it says UK size 12, which I am, and fits me perfectly. I got standard shipping but it literally arrived in two days time, it was so efficient and beautifully packaged! I recommend Odd Muse to everyone I know all of the time x	2024-05-23	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/667020b4abad2516175d96ed	0.20011904761904764	neutral	["odd", "muse", "quality", "dress", "know", "time", "obsessed", "follow", "brand", "socials"]

6341	oddmuselondon	Sky	As a usually silent muse, I really felt the need to search for a platform after my visit to the Flagship Store in London this weekend. From the moment I walked into the shop, the experience was incredible. Clean, friendly faces and A LOT of customers. For a smaller sized store, having a large volume of customers could’ve been at a detriment to my experience, but not at all! The staff were so on it, offering water bottles to EVERYONE in store not just us queuing for the fitting rooms. Now to the clothing, outstanding, exceptional. I found the brand after following Aimee for some time and wanted to ensure for my first purchase I went into store. Despite the original item I desired not being in store, I still walked away with a beautiful jumpsuit that I love. My only downside was not purchasing the perfume whilst in store, I will now make a trip especially for it because I simply cannot get enough! Because of this I emailed customer service who were so quick to respond so a massive thank you to Kresna, the ladies in the store (I wish I got your names… one with a beautiful black bob and the other with stunning brown hair)!Safe to say I will be back asap!

My original dress for our registry office was just not giving me confidence and then I took the plunge and ordered the The Ultimate Muse Bow Midi Dress! Absolutely stunning, the sizing is amazing, the quality and the originality is sooo nice. I got so many compliments in this dress and my now husband even said I could have worn it to our big Italian wedding the week after and was worried my dress for that day may not make me feel as good!I also wore the strapless mini for my reception in Italy and once again I’m just obsessed. So fun and flirty, great to dance the night away in!Starting my new job tomorrow and will definitely be wearing the navy mini skirt and navy jacket with some red sling backs.

6366	oddmuselondon	Ambyr Rios	The item availability is still limited, as is the information about sizing in advance of ordering. While they mention the stretch varies based on the item, which is normal, they do not have images available for anyone between the size of XS and XL-- which would cover most of the customer base. Additionally, the rather rigorously enforced return policy, and the items being shipped out of the UK, means that people are spending good amounts of money on items they have very little information amount without a reliable way to return pieces. I saw many reviews that show a variance in fit (dramatically) and then also a problem with returning the items. This is concerning as a customer, especially with the limited inventory and "order ahead" mentality. I think having additional images of different sizes (the sizes most of the population wears), having reviews on the pages with the items, and figuring out their inventory/ shipping issues would go a long way. As for me, the items I ordered weren't going to ship until after my trip began. The return process before the ordered shipped was quick, and customer service was friendly and supportive. I just wish there was more information available before my order and that items were shipped in a more timely fashion. All growing pains, but at this pricepoint, people want concierge level service.	2024-06-10	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/666881696bff68d415c98f40	0.22608630952380954	neutral	["items", "information", "customer", "return", "shipped", "item", "limited", "images", "available", "would"]

6378	oddmuselondon	SHJ	The sizing of these dresses is absolutely ridiculous. I had to order an XXL and I’m a size 12/14 - make it make sense. They are also SO short. I’m 5ft7 so I wouldn’t even class myself as “tall” and I can’t wear them they’re so short. I was excited for their tall range but by the looks of it, the dresses are only 2 inches longer making next to no difference. Not everyone wants to wear a dress that’s on the literal cusp of their bum cheeks, it’s such a shame because the designs are lovely. I don’t understand why you’d go to the trouble of making a tall range that’s makes the dresses go from unwearable - to still ridiculously short for the average tall girl	2024-05-28	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6656202f7419071d5230132f	0.03263888888888889	neutral	["tall", "dresses", "short", "make", "wear", "range", "making", "sizing", "absolutely", "ridiculous"]

6379	oddmuselondon	Sarah	I have always adored this brand but this review relates solely to their customer care which is non-existent. They were very vocal on their socials that next day orders for their new collection would arrive in time for the weekend and their website confirms orders placed before 5pm will be despatched same day. So I ordered £550 worth on a Thursday morning based on their reassurance. It hasn’t arrived and has not even been despatched.I’m not as unreasonable to expect that nothing will ever go wrong but there has been 0 communication about what the issue is, and they’re obviously happy to keep my money without informing me. It’s apparent I’m not the only one affected so even just a one liner on their socials so people are aware - instead they’re posting more content suggesting items are “in stock for immediate despatch” which is clearly misleading when there are obvious issues.It’s left a really sour taste in my mouth. That said the clothes are lovely and I wouldn’t necessarily be put off from ordering again dependent on when and how this issue is resolved, but the advertising and customer service needs an awful lot of work. The brand could be so close to perfection.	2024-05-25	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66521aa88e3160da30e89bc7	0.06590909090909092	neutral	["brand", "customer", "socials", "day", "orders", "even", "issue", "one", "always", "adored"]

6382	oddmuselondon	Kathryn Sullivan	In love with Odd Muse!I stumbled across the ultimate muse strapless dress in white while looking for a college graduation dress. I was in love with the classiness and style of the dress but was saddened to find out it was a pre-order. Saddened, I emailed the store to see when they would be getting the dress back in stock. I was responded to extremely fast and told because my occasion was so special, that if I put an order in they would put me on a priority shipping list. I agreed and ordered the dress, to my surprise the dress was shipped out maybe about a week later or maybe shorter. I know the store is located in the UK and I am from Western New York, so I thought it might take a bit for me to receive. But again, nope, I was pleasantly surprised again when I received text messages updating me on the status of the package and it had been delivered just a few days after being shipped from the UK. I was delighted to open the package and see a bright white dress, with amazing quality. I am 5'9 and around 150 lbs so I have an issue with dresses being long enough for me or fitting at times. I tried the dress on and it was absolutely perfect. It covered my butt, fit perfectly, and looked absolutely stunning on. A month later I wore the gorgeous white dress to my college graduation and the dress was adored by many. I received endless compliments on the dress and my graduation photos look absolutely amazing! So many people have asked me on my Instagram where the dress was from as well that's how much this dress was adored. I was so impressed by the company that I emailed them thanking them for being so great. I will definitely be ordering from them again in the near future and would/have recommend(ed) to anyone and everyone! Between the quick and extremely helpful responses from their team, the fast shipping, the quality and style of the dress, and everything in between. This is a new favorite store of mine and I would support this small business anyday!	2024-03-29	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/664e1a91250b5dff2d27be67	0.27122810901219996	neutral	["dress", "white", "graduation", "store", "would", "absolutely", "love", "college", "style", "saddened"]

6387	oddmuselondon	Megan	Love the pieces the brand put out but I always struggle with sizing! Would be nice if there was a fuller bust option as I feel like the dresses are only aimed at girls with small chests. I am XS/S but the dresses are always tight on the top! I also can’t order multiple sizes due to the poor returns policy, as i don’t want to be stuck with store credit for somewhere the clothes don’t fit me. I understand the brand is small but it’s really difficult to buy from them when there aren’t many shops that stock the items to try on and the website doesn’t let you have a cash refund!

This company is an embarrassment they then had the cheek to offer me a free delivery code for my next order which will never happen! Awful company and actually awful quality for the prices they charge for basic items, save your time, stress and money!	2024-05-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6641272afed84966c07514aa	-0.2285714285714286	negative	["days", "company", "order", "showing", "stock", "delivery", "working", "items", "actually", "awful"]

The dresses themselves are stunning, the quality is great and the silhouette’s are so flattering, I’m a size 12 with a broader upper body so was slightly worried about the fit, but the large was perfect and cinches at the waist perfectly! 10/10 could not recommend Odd Muse more, both the customer service and garments themselves are delightful!	2024-04-30	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6635fb1b0d6ce387b6406868	0.40095238095238095	positive	["dresses", "worried", "customer", "service", "ordered", "graduation", "arrive", "time", "emailed", "get"]

6405	oddmuselondon	Natalie Knoth	I love my Ultimate Muse Pearl Dress and am so happy with the improved sizing! I had tried a couple sizes when it first launched and didn't have any luck, so I was nervous to reorder. I found the relaunched dress to be very true to size. Totally understandable for the fit to require some tweaking and I'm glad I gave Odd Muse another go!The pearl dress is very high quality and timeless, definitely a forever piece. I'm not a bride-to-be and I like how email campaigns are inclusive to all—what girl doesn't deserve a pretty white dress. :) I'm excited to add more Odd Muse to my collection, especially as I start to invest in (reasonably priced) sustainable luxury. I've loved watching Aimee's journey too, she's such an inspiration.

6407	oddmuselondon	Sharon Carey	I feel so let down by this company. I’m always trying to help small businesses out by ordering directly from them and cutting out the big corporate firms but the customer service I have received from Odd Muse has been shocking. I ordered a lovely dress but when it arrived, the fit was way off. (I’m only 5’ so I’m used to clothes being too long/big for me, but I really loved the dress so I took a chance) As expected, the fit was all wrong. Too big around the bust and far too long, I reluctantly sent the dress back. Within 3 days and with tags intact. To my disbelief, I received an email from Oddmuse saying that due to prolonged use, they were refusing to refund my money. I’m so upset because there’s no way I could have worn the dress as it just didn’t fit and they are basically calling me dishonest. I protested their decision but it fell on deaf ears. They stated that I agreed to their terms and conditions when I ordered so that’s the end of it. I then went on to read their terms and conditions (something I don’t really deem necessary when ordering-I will from now on) and it basically says they can refuse anything for any reason at any time! So so disappointed. I really wanted to support this fledgling company but I feel like I’ve been deceived and taken for a ride. Shame on you Odd Muse. You’ve lost what could have been a future loyal customer 😢	2024-03-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/662a557ddf2303e2be816286	-0.028639846743295026	neutral	["dress", "fit", "really", "feel", "company", "big", "customer", "received", "odd", "muse"]
6408	oddmuselondon	LucyM	I ordered an Odd Muse strapless black dress on pre-order as I saw the dresses on Instagram and absolutely loved the look of them. The pre-order dispatch date was initially 20th March, I contacted them on the 25th March as I’d not had any updates on the dispatch and I was told the new dispatch date was pushed back two weeks, luckily I’d not needed the dress until a July event so I didn’t mind about the delay, but I had to chase them up to find this out. The dress finally arrived on the 8th April. The dress arrived size S and the fit was way too big for me, I was gutted as I loved the dress, I initially wanted to exchange for a smaller size but was advised there could be limited availability on preorders and I didn’t want to risk the smaller size not fitting me so I opted for a refund. I shipped the dress back off for a refund 4 days after I’d received it the dress was sent back on the 12th April. I had no notification on the progress of the refund until I emailed them again for an update on 22nd April, only to find that the refund request had been rejected due to the returns outcome stating ‘prolonged wear and not fragrance free’ which is an outright lie, I’d tried the dress on for a matter of minutes, it didn’t fit so I shipped it back off days later when I could get to the post office. I went back to them to explain this and they responded with another rejection outright refusing to process the refund.  I have followed up with another email to ODD Muse and I’ve not had any further response from them. Not only had the customer service experience been poor throughout, to completely LIE and make up that the dress had been worn just so they didn’t have to process a refund is disgusting, bare in mind how expensive their dresses are. Their comments of ‘prolonged wear’ contradict themselves as how can it show signs of prolonged wear when it was shipped straight back off days after receiving. I’d avoid purchasing from this company unless you want to be ripped off. This is completely unacceptable and everyone should and legally are entitled to a refund if their item doesn’t fit.	2024-04-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6627fbbe611ca490e4445757	0.02034916837548416	neutral	["dress", "refund", "back", "dispatch", "april", "size", "fit", "shipped", "days", "prolonged"]
6409	oddmuselondon	Amy	When I first saw the ultimate muse split sleeve dress I knew it was the perfect dress for my hen. I ordered the size M originally, and it arrived the day after! It came up slightly too big, but I didn’t know if I was to go down a size it would be too tight. I ordered the size S praying it would fit, and it honestly fit like a glove. I wore it on my hen do and I have never had so many compliments on a dress as I did with this one.

I have several dresses from them and I am sure they will last me a lifetime and also never go out of style. When I wear Odd Muse people comment on my style and it makes me happy to support a brand that elevates my wardrobe and that I also believe in. I am always excited about their new launches and think they are an inspiration for many people who want to start a business themselves because they have such solid marketing.

6411	oddmuselondon	Sarah Coll	I had ordered a dress about a month ago because i adore Aimee's collection entirely. and returned unfortunately because it didnt fit. Katie Sears could not have been more accommodating, kind and caring regarding my refund. She was very prompt, informative and helpful to get me the help I needed. This may not apply...but I have been having a tough week, I sadly had to send my soul husky pup 'Angel' over the rainbow bridge last week aged 12.  Not only has my head been in a rough spot, not being able to send the email to her correctly wih all the information, and i was worried I was maybe gonna fall through the cracks, but she still managed to find my order and sort me out. Their service is very pro active and managed well. The fact she was so prompt means I can bring my baby girl home from the vets to set her free, and I will definitely be shopping back here again.

6431	oddmuselondon	Ellie Beech	Ordered 3 dresses to try on for an engagement party, 1 of which being the high neck satin dress. Tried on for a couple of minutes to discover that the fit of the dress was bad quality, zipper bunched up at the lower back and the back of the neck was far too high, so it looked silly without hair down to cover. On returning the item, I stated the problems with the fitting of the dress and was told that the return could not be accepted due to “signs of wear for a significant time”, in my possession there were no signs of wear and they have been unable to provide me proof of such signs. Would not purchase from here again, in my opinion they need to improve the sizing/fitting of dresses. Considering the cost of the dresses it unacceptable to refuse a return on an item which is not of merchantable quality.	2024-04-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6618cfcdb2ac6df3bd405346	-0.020396825396825382	neutral	["dresses", "dress", "signs", "high", "neck", "quality", "back", "item", "return", "wear"]

Now let me tell you I was SO nervous ordering, especially given some of the insta comments about tall girls and it being appropriate for work. Now I’m 5’8 and my torso is short, and this was the PERFECT work dress! I work in corporate London in finance and TikTok was suggestion is wasn’t fitting - I disagree. Had so many compliments too and people recognised the brand immediately! Love love love and cannot wait for the co ord to be restocked.	2024-04-03	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/661833ffbd58a78a332612b5	0.36160714285714285	positive	["dress", "work", "love", "eye", "ord", "store", "insta", "ordering", "oddmuse", "months"]

6435	oddmuselondon	Mia Connolly	I wore the The Ultimate Muse Satin Straight Neck Mini Dress in black today for a photoshoot and it was seriously the most stunning dress I have ever worn! I felt so confident and beautiful in it, it fit me so well where usually shorter dresses don’t. It was so nice to wear a short dress and not feel worried my bum would show because it’s the perfect length. I want to buy this dress after wearing it for a few hours and it’s so affordable too. It’s the perfect little black dress! xx	2024-04-11	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6617c071f1a71aaa0c3987d1	0.254656862745098	neutral	["dress", "black", "perfect", "wore", "ultimate", "muse", "satin", "straight", "neck", "mini"]

6440	oddmuselondon	Georgia Andersen	I cannot rave enough about the stunning dresses I purchased. As someone who is usually very self-conscious about my appearance, finding dresses that make me feel confident and beautiful can be a challenge. However, these dresses exceeded all of my expectations. The quality of the fabric and craftsmanship is impeccable. The dresses fit me like a glove and accentuated all of the right places. I wore one to a wedding and the other to my own engagement party, and I received so many compliments. In fact, multiple people asked me if the dresses had been custom-made for me. I have never felt more radiant and elegant than I did in these dresses. Thank you for creating such beautiful pieces that have boosted my confidence and made me feel truly special. I will definitely be a repeat customer in the future.

6459	oddmuselondon	Sam M	First, I've seen reviews about the quality of the pieces, and I haven't received it yet, but I 100% trust that it's going to be absolutely stunning. What I do want to comment on is their customer service which is top tier. To sum it up, my wedding was unexpectedly turned into an elopement and I needed a dress. I ordered this while it was in pre-order and didn't notice it would ship in May when I needed it in late April. I have been eying this dress for months and didn't pull the trigger until I absolutely needed it, which put me a bad spot. Just hoping to get clarity, I reached out to the company (shout out to Krizia!) and they were EXCEPTIONAL. They were kind enough to be transparent, but because of my situation with my grandfather, they ran it up the chain and was able to get me my dress earlier, ensuring I would have it for my elopement. I'm so so grateful for them, not just for the dress, but the compassion and care and just human experience. I know I'm just a customer, but I feel so special and I'm grateful to them for helping make my big day even more so memorable.	2024-04-01	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/660d880ec4805056ff29ef9d	0.205812324929972	neutral	["dress", "needed", "absolutely", "customer", "elopement", "didnt", "would", "get", "grateful", "first"]

6461	oddmuselondon	Lucy Wheeler	Very disappointed to have to write such a negative review as I love this company and its designs. However, I spent over £250 on the odd muse website for dresses for my 21st birthday, as it said that they would be shipped on or before the 21st of March. This date came and I had no further shipping confirmations etc from the company, so I checked the website and they had changed this shipping date to the 15th May! They didn’t think to notify me of this change, so if I hadn’t have checked my self I would have been waiting for 2 months for £250 worth of dresses (my 21st birthday is in April anyway, so it would be too late).Customer service were very helpful and issued me with a full refund, being very apologetic. However, I just think that it is wrong and very disappointing from the company, and it has put me off ordering from this brand again.	2024-03-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/660d37d5df82ac4f341e5325	-0.07947916666666667	neutral	["company", "21st", "would", "however", "\\u00a3250", "website", "dresses", "birthday", "date", "shipping"]

When the sale finally opened at 11, to my surprise the space was tiny, so we didn’t get inside until nearly 2pm. Half of the already tiny shop was faulty items and there was barely any space to move. Given how the brand has grown they could have anticipated the large turn out and in turn hosted in a bigger space. The clothes are ok but I don’t think the quality is anything to shout about.	2024-03-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6606a2d6f144bc2776b9fbe8	0.0775132275132275	neutral	["space", "sale", "already", "tiny", "turn", "arrived", "sample", "9am", "300", "people"]
6474	oddmuselondon	Vee	The quality and fit of the clothes were good.But they need to work on customer service. We were at their store in Covent Garden and the sales rep was quite rude and unhelpful. She not only gave us dirty looks but when we asked for sizes she refused to go check the back and claimed they were out of stock. Yet when other customers asked for the same piece and size she went back to check and was super nice and helpful. That was a bit frustrating so we left. My friend returned just an hour later, and the sales rep miraculously had all the size we initially asked for.

6488	oddmuselondon	jon e	I ordered two dresses from Odd Muse for my girlfriend. This was my first time ordering from this company  . Unfortunately the sizing for both dresses did not workout. I returned the dresses and have received notification that only one dress was refunded, I’ve contacted them and they’re claiming to only have received one dress back when I sent both dresses in the return. I have therefore now lost $232 for dress cost and tax and duty of $88.00 for no reason at all, just from ordering from this company.  In addition to return the two dresses the shipping fee was deducted. Really terrible experience, will not be ordering again even if they figure out their sizing . I sent them the receipt when I mailed the package (used their package to return)  Everyone be extremely careful with returns and sizing from this company as it does not work for every girl and body shape.  please contact me if anyone has had the same experience. If you live in Europe the chances of getting refund are higher compare to North America. North American's get ready to lose money in duty tax and shipping fee. If they do not receive the dress get ready to lose that money as well.	2024-03-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66019bb733fff79cc8da3df5	-0.05216450216450218	neutral	["dresses", "dress", "ordering", "company", "sizing", "return", "two", "received", "one", "sent"]

6508	oddmuselondon	Bethany Tomlinson	Really frustrating for my first ever experience and it will be my last. I ordered the long sleeve black dress a week ago. When it came it was the wrong dress and when I reached out to customer service they asked me to return it back before re ordering it again which is fine, but given that this is their mistake I would expect some sort of compensation. I actually had to press them for any kind of compensation or discount considering I now have to go out of my way to return this one before buying a new one before I likely even get a refund. This took a span of 3-4 days and by the time they agreed to compensate me the dress is now no longer immediately available and only on pre order. Complete waste of my time and a very frustrating customer service experience.

Which brings me back the dress for more than 200 €... I decide not to pay the customs fees and return the dress.. Because it would also have cost 30 € to return the dress if it did not fit me!I received my refund today. and what a surprise to see that on an order of 170 € I am refunded only 100 € ... it is a SHAME	2024-02-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65e07a4f6e6de6ef0c119249	0.04285714285714286	neutral	["dress", "let", "surprise", "pay", "customs", "fees", "return", "testimony", "mostly", "customer"]

6569	oddmuselondon	Chelsea Davies	I must say, the customer service is UNBELIEVABLE!! So I’ve been trying to order a dress online but unfortunately it’s on pre order, which is fine and understandable but I get married in 5 weeks and I am dying for this dress as my wedding dress! I emailed directly, come back to me instantly with all my questions and asked if they had the dress is store, explained how far I am travelling so went back and forth with the warehouse so I didn’t have to travel and kept me updated the whole time. In the end, I’ve decided to go to the shop and travel, told their customers services and they went to the store to make sure they would keep the dress aside for me. Everyone I spoke to was so lovely and kept me updated the whole time. I’ve been very stressed about my situation recently and they have took a weight off me.

6583	oddmuselondon	Jordie Lilly	Odd Muse dresses are of excellent quality and arrive promptly. While they may be pricier, I find them well worth it due to their exceptional quality. However, shipping costs, especially to New Zealand, can be steep. Returns are also costly, making it impractical for international customers like myself. Despite this, I purchased the white satin mini dress for an engagement shoot and had to shorten it by two inches for a better fit. Nevertheless, I was so impressed that I bought more dresses, including a black sleeve dress and a grey V-neck long dress for my birthday party. Interestingly, the black mini dress didn't require any alterations, unlike the white satin one. Note, these dresses would be too short for my office, unless I wore tights underneath, that’s just me though. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchases and will continue to buy from Odd Muse, especially now that I know my size and have noticed my friends also enjoying their dresses. I hope they expand to department stores in New Zealand soon.	2024-02-20	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65d3a04caf580bbc70c0a8a2	0.21536363636363634	neutral	["dresses", "dress", "odd", "muse", "quality", "especially", "new", "zealand", "also", "white"]

6592	oddmuselondon	Veronica	The return process absolutely is the worst ever. I ordered a dress, didn’t fit even though I measured and went based off of their online sizing guide so I had to return it. Due to me being in the US, they didn’t offer exchange, refunds only where I had to pay for postage to send back to the UK ASIDE from paying $25 shipping to get this dress. I’m out $100 on just shipping charges alone and no dress because the exchange didn’t fit either. Unethical company who should improve their shipping and exchange policy. Will never order from them again and will advise friends and family to avoid OM until they get some sort of shipping improvements or partner in the US.	2024-02-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65cfa87406a4a799b02fe2b8	-0.017857142857142856	neutral	["shipping", "dress", "exchange", "return", "fit", "get", "process", "absolutely", "worst", "ever"]

6597	oddmuselondon	Abbi	I ordered two dresses from Odd Muse for my wedding celebrations in June. This was my first time ordering from this company. Unfortunately as we are getting married in South of France the dresses were too thick and I felt the material would be too heavy. I returned the dresses and have recieved notification that only one dress was refunded, I’ve contacted them and they’re claiming to only have recieved one dress back when I packaged both dresses in the return. I have therefore now lost £165 for no reason at all, just from ordering from this company. Really bad experience, will not be ordering again. Everyone be extremely careful with returns and please contact me if anyone has had the same experience.	2024-02-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65cb69328224262a6ed9f6fb	-0.12222222222222222	negative	["dresses", "ordering", "company", "recieved", "one", "dress", "experience", "ordered", "two", "odd"]

6612	oddmuselondon	Ana	I pre ordered a dress from them on 12/26/23. By the 29th it was on its way. The dress was $162, shipping $25 because I live in the US so a total of $187. It arrives on 1/5/24 and is so short it doesn’t even cover my bum which is crazy. I was extremely disappointed but should have probably looked at the measurements. I ship it out to them 1/6/24. I end up emailing the support team on 1/15/24 asking for an update and I received an email telling me it would take 14 working days… moments later I receive an email that looks like they sent to all of their customers saying it would take up to 14 days for a refund. I email again on 1/23/24. I express how this is a terrible shopping experience and the response is the exact same from the 15th. Finally, I email again on the 29th just simply asking for an update in which they responded they were working on orders that came in on 1/8/24. I finally receive a confirmation of my “refund” on 2/1/24 it being $137, which is less then I paid for the dress to begin with. I received awful customer support in my opinion and paid $50 out of pocket total for shipping and they took forever to give me a refund confirmation. It hasn’t showed up with my bank yet because they say it can take up to 10 more days. This whole process doesn’t seem legal. They clearly don’t have enough people to fulfill the return demand, they also claimed it was from black Friday but per their return policy that wouldn’t make any sense. They say one thing on the website, mass email their customers another, then email you personally another. They don’t have much about it on their website so just beware when you are buying something from there especially if you are in the US. I’m just honestly happy to be getting some money back but still a little in shock by the “customer service”. Also some of these 5 star reviews look fake just do your research.	2024-01-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65bb9885a6e9d9163943235d	-0.07087391774891773	neutral	["email", "dress", "take", "refund", "29th", "shipping", "total", "support", "asking", "update"]

6629	oddmuselondon	Holly Jordan	Odd Muse massively needs to invest in legal support to get their policies in line with statutory law, specifically their returns policy. I’m writing this in hope that it will help anyone else in the same position as I was, as I could’ve lost nearly £250 because the company was refusing to give me a refund…and by looking at the other reviews about returns, it sounds as though a lot customers have lost money because they weren’t aware of their statutory rights. So, I returned the goods within 28 days. Odd Muse refused to give me a refund and instead issued a credit note.  The company kept referring me to their 14 day returns policy on their website and said they couldn’t refund me.  A company can have any policy copied & pasted on their website…..but it doesn’t mean that it is capable of overriding UK law!  For anyone that doesn’t know, for goods bought online: “If the item was bought online, over the phone or by mail order, as a customer you have consumer returns rights under the Consumer Contracts Regulations. The Consumer Contracts Regulations give you a cancellation period that starts the moment you place your order and ends 14 days from the day you receive your goods. You then have a further 14 days from the date you notify the retailer that you'd like to cancel your order to return the goods.”Despite the above, which I politely explained to them, the company refused to refund me 3 times. As soon as I said that I was going to report them to Trading Standards, I magically got a refund. So if you find yourself in this position, don’t take their word and research your rights. Not a good look Odd Muse…..from an ex-customer whose view of the company is now tainted. You can’t claim girl power and all that when you refuse to return money to the people it legally belongs to!	2024-01-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65ace459e1823f761f9bb028	0.016406250000000004	neutral	["company", "returns", "goods", "refund", "odd", "policy", "give", "rights", "days", "order"]

I waited over 6 weeks from first order for initial delivery and then an exchange. The item, arrived after the event I had ordered for, and I didn't feel it was good quality for the high price, so I returned the item. When the item arrived to me the label wasn't attached properly, which I have photo evidence of, but their team are claiming I have violated their return and refusing to refund me without providing any evidence from their side. I've now had to open a dispute with my bank to try to recover the cost since their customer service team is ignoring my questions and implying I am lying.I would recommend to everyone to avoid this company	2024-01-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/659ec497231c3683c4be2a69	0.062222222222222213	neutral	["item", "customer", "service", "company", "first", "delivery", "return", "arrived", "evidence", "team"]

6649	oddmuselondon	Samson Rattigan BEM	Worst place ever!! I brought my GF a dress from their website, the dress was too small, I instantly brought the same dress in the size up and sent the smaller dress back. They did not approve the refund!!! They claimed that the dress was in ‘worn condition’ it was literally put on for a second and the zip would not do up as it was too small, so I folded the dress nicely and put it back into its packaging and returned! It took over a month for Odd Muse to review the dress, they did not send me any communication at all, I just received a messages from Royal Mail stating my odd Muse package would arrive which made me super confused! To my amazement the dress I returned was back at my door! After some back and fourth emails with incompetent employees who could barley string a sentence together. After I quoted their breach of the consumers rights act 2015, they simply decided to ignore me. At this point I had a bee in my bonnet and thought about taking them to small claims court, but after a cup of tea decided it wasn’t worth my time. I ended up reselling the dress on eBay for a tiny loss, the customer who purchased the dress was super happy with the ‘new’ condition it was sold in. I will never ever purchase anything from Odd Muse again and will go one step further and share my horrible customer experience and smear their name through thicker mud than it’s already covered in.	2023-11-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/658c6c8423cc7bf8c863589d	-0.057034632034632035	neutral	["dress", "back", "small", "odd", "muse", "ever", "brought", "condition", "put", "would"]
6650	oddmuselondon	Laura G	Unfortunately feel the need to write this review to let others know of the terrible experience I am currently having with Odd Muse. Unfortunately, my parcel never arrived. It was “delivered” by Royal Mail but left outside my front door, in an unsafe place, on a busy main road. This was without my permission. Unfortunately, when getting in touch with Odd Muse they have completely passed the buck, suggesting that they have “fulfilled their part” in my order by giving it to Royal Mail, and since my delivery didn’t need a signature, the fact the parcel has not arrived is nothing to do with them. This is a clear breach of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and it’s disappointing to see that the business, and customer care team are unaware of the contract they entered into, and the legal process they need to follow. As per the consumer rights act, it is the sellers responsibility to ensure my parcel is in my possession, not just left anywhere by the delivery company. “If you didn’t provide delivery instructions, the retailer has failed to fulfil its contract with you and is legally bound to refund or replace your order.” Despite following up with legal advice and having spoken to the citizens advice team Odd Muse are still refusing to refund/replace my items. I ordered the items on the 23rd November and it’s not looking like until the end of January at the earliest before I get either a refund or replacement. This is disgusting in the middle of a cost of living crisis. I am deeply disappointed that a brand of this size is unaware of the laws, legislation and regulations that they are bound to and will never ever purchase from them again. Do better Odd Muse and please stop telling me you are following the correct procedure when you simply are not.	2023-12-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6586f902bb802ed309f70471	-0.14833333333333334	negative	["odd", "muse", "unfortunately", "need", "parcel", "delivery", "never", "arrived", "royal", "mail"]

6663	oddmuselondon	Courtney Goodwin	After the barbaric customer service from this company I will NEVER order or purchase from them again. I ordered a dress on pre order (that when I ordered wasn’t actually marked as a preorder but I didn’t need it for a few weeks so let that one slide) and when it arrived was not the quality I would of expected for a £175 dress so I opted to return. I returned using the Oddmuse return service and agreed to pay return via their courier, sent back the same day it arrived and eventually after a week got an email to state it had been received by them (despite it being a first class postage label). So as of 23/11/2023 I was told 10 working days maximum… nearly two weeks and 14 working days later no return and not a single message from the company for an update. They then changed the returns to 14 working days… this will be almost a month since they received it.  You message and message and email and WhatsApp and get nothing back.Every single order I have made with this company has been the same, they take your money send you an overpriced dress and will haggle to not give you a refund. Shocking. Oh, and you dont get refunded the full amount either. They knock a random amount off. One order they known around 13% off and the other 7%.

It has been well over a month and I am still waiting for the refund I am due!Customer service is appalling.They ignore your emails most of the time and contact number does not work.I purchased two dresses from them previously, with no issues. I purchased a third item which is where the problem began when they need to refund you they will not do this. I guess they hope you will give up as the amount of emailing you have to do is very tiresome it’s almost £200 I am waiting to get back. This is unacceptable and as you can see from all other reviews online, I am far from the only person this has happened to. This is clearly a regular occurrence from this company so just bare  this in mind if you purchase from this company and need to return or have a problem, you will more than likely not get your money back or have to fiercely fight to try to get your refund !This company do not care about customer satisfaction, only making their money by holding onto yours!

6670	oddmuselondon	Emily	Literally miserable. Product is fine, but if you are US based you are going to pay around $30 in shipping. Which is fine unless you need to return—which is where my personal hell started. I needed to size down, so I paid another $30 for a new size to be shipped (since they don’t accept exchanges) then I had to pay another $30 to ship the original dress that didn’t fit back. A regret ever ordering from them. $100 alone on shipping items. If that wasn’t enough, they hold you return money hostage for over a month. They recieved my return 3 weeks ago and didn’t refund me until today. I kept getting “apolgies” for the delay but no real action.

I then had to chase again to be told they needed a tracking number as they couldn’t track my return. I sent this and still have yet to receive an update.

It doesn’t take 3 weeks to process a refund, I own a large scale e-commerce biz and our refunds are done within 48 hours (without fail) It’s a disgraceful way to treat customers, and I for one won’t use odd muse again, and I am sadly going to post a review about this on socials, such a shame a fun and lovely brand will be impacted by missing the very BASICSUpdate to say still no refund on 3rd dec	2023-11-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6565ae0cd337bb306efae7ef	0.004244306418219463	neutral	["refund", "return", "sadly", "within", "working", "brand", "9th", "november", "refunds", "one"]

Would have been quicker to just re buy the dress and get a refund. First time I had spoken with the chat function I was told to simply wait my turn and be patient. Even though it had already been a week and I hadn’t received even a email. Second time. Was told they were processing my refund. But I didn’t want a refund I just wanted the dress in a smaller size. So frustrating. My biggest issue overall is that there is no communication whatsoever from odd muse. No email to say they got the dress, no email to say they are processing it. No email to apologise for the wait. Simply awful customer service. Shame really because the dresses are beautiful and the quality is good…but do run large.

It was when this brand was fairly new so I knew I needed something special for such a special occasion & it made me feel just that ✨ I have never received so many compliments of an item of clothing as much as this dress! 100% worth the price - only issue is the designs run quite small especially for fuller busts but nothing that can’t be fixed!

6717	oddmuselondon	Anton	My girlfriend ordered a dress with the Middle East department 2 weeks ago, it was advertised as “same day delivery” for an extra charge. Up to now no one knows where the parcel is if it exists at all.They don’t tell the tracking number, because they “don’t keep tracking numbers for UAE”. No notifications/calls received from DHL by the corresponding telephone number.This all looks very much a scam.EDIT: Finally today (after 2 weeks of battling with support) someone from the UAE facility got in touch and sent a photo of the package left near the apartment door. They say it was delivered on 3rd (the next day after she checked out), but the security checked the cameras footage and haven’t seen anyone. We spent so much time already trying to locate the package in the building to no success. All that because the delivery guy thought it’s a good idea to just throw the package on the floor and walk away, no calls, no WhatsApp message and of course this wonderful customer support who couldn’t provide any adequate help for 2 WEEKS.So today it’s her last night in Dubai and she’s crying…	2023-10-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/652af6683c8eeb0ad9ce1f45	0.14645833333333333	neutral	["package", "weeks", "day", "delivery", "tracking", "uae", "much", "today", "support", "checked"]

They then said they could not accept my return because It did not meet the requirements of their return policy. All of which was a LIE. I will now be doing a chargeback. The sizing guide is highly inaccurate, and they do not allow you to do a return. I emailed them 5 minutes after DHL delivered my order that it didn't fit, and now they are saying it doesn't meet their standards. The most heartbreaking thing was that I ordered this dress for my wedding weekend. What a joke. Incompetent people who cannot run a business. Shop elsewhere. They now have the poorly made dress AND my money. This is the very reason you don't support small businesses.

6731	oddmuselondon	Leah	I had ordered the Ultimate muse white strapless dress on the 13th of August, I was aware this dress was on pre-order which I was completely fine with as I understand these items are popular and sell out quickly. The directions of this pre-order was that it would be dispatched on or before 19th of September, which was ideal for me as I had planned to wear this for my 21st birthday, and this would have meant it would of been delivered in time. However, I waited until the 19th and I received no update on shipment, I then decided to contact them via their WhatsApp customer services on the 20th of September, I was told the dress would be dispatched that day, which I was happy with. The dress was not dispatched, at this point I am starting to get concerned. I then contacted them again, voicing my concerns, to which they replied and said the dress would be dispatched no later then the 22nd of September and it would be shipped out with next day delivery, this too I was happy with as it felt like my concerns were being listened to. I messaged them on the 22nd at 13:32 (inside there working hours) to double check my order was still being dispatched and I received no response, not even the automated message that I had received before when I had messaged which was concerning. I waited until 23:00 on the 22nd and I had received no shipment notification or response, so I then decided to message them on WhatsApp again, email them, contact their Instagram and tik tok account, and also comment on their content. I have since received no response, no update on shipment or any acknowledgment in general. Now it is too late to wear this outfit for my birthday and the £129.50 I have spent with them is pointless. I no longer even want my order to be shipped, I just want a full refund including shipping cost as my order was never shipped! I have emailed them again to state this, and messaged their WhatsApp (to which I still am not receiving the automated reply which I had previously received, whether they have blocked my contact I am not sure) I understand they have been busier with the new launches and runway, but I don’t think that other customers who have ordered from them should be neglected, I have never ordered from there brand before, and I am upset because their pieces look lovely and I love what the brand stands for, but their customer service has been terrible and their lack of customer attention has too.	2023-09-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65115a02c4198a35e3d4d3be	0.12614989177489175	neutral	["would", "received", "dress", "dispatched", "ordered", "september", "shipment", "contact", "whatsapp", "customer"]

6733	oddmuselondon	Thayssa Caliman	Update* Got the issue resolved with Odd Muse. They sent over the full order with a free shipping voucher for next order or returning process, the owner itself reached out to me which I think is a very clever business move, perhaps I think the proper manner would be giving a gift card certificate or discount code to the costumer reflecting the disruption of waiting more than 10 days for a "3-5 days guarantee delivery order" i would be definitely more satisfied and would prob  give them 5 starts. I will still purchase from ODD Muse because their quality is impeccable and the design is super chic. I am hoping the type of issue I had never happens again. I’ll keep you guys posted on upcoming orders. * update purchased several pieces from ODD Muse and haven’t experienced any similar issue thereafter.	2023-09-10	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/650eefff8b39d1c63745e9b4	0.24062500000000003	neutral	["issue", "odd", "muse", "order", "would", "update", "think", "days", "got", "resolved"]

6745	oddmuselondon	Mollie Jones	Can't actually believe the experience I have had with a brand I have followed for so long. I bought a jumpsuit, it was out of the box for less than 5 minutes and I immediately returned it all, in the exact same condition it arrived. Odd Muse took over two weeks to process my refund and then I had an email to say part of the order was not returned to them. Apparently, there were two belts with the jumpsuit but I confirmed there was only one thick belt in the order received. Everything I had, I returned.Odd muse have refused to provide a refund, failed to show any accountability that it could indeed be their mistake to begin with by not providing me with all belts, and they have also posted the item back to me. Not only have they refused a refund, but the belt was never included in my order to begin with, so the item is therefore faulty and they didn't fulfil the full order.I have gone over and over this with Odd Muse and they have shown an unwillingness to listen, suggesting I have kept the additional belt. What would I do with a spare belt? I would have no use for it if I returned the jumpsuit? Of course, if I had it I would return it so my refund could be processed. The parcel has now arrived back with me and it is exactly what I received in the first place so the missing belt was obviously never included in the initial order by odd muse in the first place. I've emailed to clarify this and request another refund due to a faulty product and am currently awaiting a response, although they have ignored my last 3 emails!Would never ever use this retailer again, and one to avoid at all costs. I've never been refused a refund in my life!! Crazy service when their pieces are so costly too. If they don't respond I'll now have half an order (with no additional belt) and will have had to pay full price (£145) for it? Wow, what customer service is that. Avoid at all costs, stick with the more known brands.

6748	oddmuselondon	Elle	I had heard conflicting reviews about OddMuse, especially regarding their sizing - some people saying their dresses run way too small and others saying the sizing is big and the dresses aren’t suitable for shorter people. As a petite person I was quite worried what my experience would be but I couldn’t be more pleasantly surprised. For reference I’m 5’2 and ordered The Ultimate Muse Cap Sleeve Mini Dress in a size XXS. It fits perfect (although wouldn’t be ideal to eat a big meal in as it does fit quite snug around the waist) and the length is ideal! You can also tell that the quality is good. The shipping was fast as well.

6768	oddmuselondon	Marie	Really disappointed with this brand. I have ordered twice from them. First time their leather trousers (which were an awful fit) and second time their jumpsuit. The sizing is so far off. I am usually a UK 10 and fit in smalls/mediums with most other brands. I decided to go with a L for the jumpsuit as I really wanted it to fit nicely and I struggled to see many people wearing it that weren’t an XS. I paid for next day delivery (the jumpsuit then took 4 days to arrive from the dispatch date). The jumpsuit then barely closed over my chest. As a DD and a size 10, pretty normal size, you would have thought a size large would be fine. I was so upset as it looked so nice on me everywhere else. The customer service for returns is then blunt and rude. I would only order from this brand if you’re slim, small chested and tall. Hopefully at some point they address the sizing issues to make the brand a bit more inclusive.	2023-06-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6486fe45557cf360177bb5ca	0.10823809523809524	neutral	["jumpsuit", "brand", "fit", "size", "would", "really", "time", "sizing", "disappointed", "ordered"]

The various styles you can wear them with make you feel like you got your money's worth. They make me feel confident and my best when I go out. The only thing I would suggest is adding an XXS size for the Ultimate Muse Blazer 2.0, Straight Leg Trousers, and jumpsuit as the XS is a bit longer on me (5'2" or 160 CM), and I'm considering getting them tailored - which I typically would never do, because I'm lazy, but again, I adore these pieces.

6837	oddmuselondon	Vasilescu, Alexandra	I’ll start with the good things first: designs and quality are 10/10, definitely something different than all fast fashion brands nowadays and clothes look very sophisticated ( I already own 2 blazers and one dress) .👍🏼 The bad things now: there’s always problems with dispatch especially when it comes to preorders. First time I have done this mistake, the dress was never dispatched as they run out of stock but still trying to charge me for delivery despite not having a date of dispatch.The dress was for a special occasion so lesson learnt. At least I thought so until I bit the bullet again during the second preorder (dumb I know right?!) now the order has been dispatched but not picked up by Royal Mail yet for 7 days now. Of course, as everyone below mentions, customer service non existent, no one will reply. Let’s just wait and see. God forbid I need to return anything in my order! 👎🏼 I just think the company is taking on more than they can handle at the moment (this what also happened during first launch of the pearl dress) and it’s reflecting on the service provided which is a pity because the designs are beautiful.	2023-05-16	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6470fcb136946122ddaf6c0b	0.18834586466165418	neutral	["dress", "first", "things", "designs", "one", "dispatched", "order", "service", "start", "good"]
6838	oddmuselondon	Liv	I ordered from oddmuse as someone who really resonates with their values: investing in your wardrobe and steering away from fast fashion. Unfortunately, despite the stunning advertisement, when I ordered a dress for my graduation I found the sizing awful. I ordered a size small which the website advertises as a size 8. As I’m usually a size 10 as I wanted a tight fit, I was apprehensive it would be too small (which I would totally be okay) but despite ordering a size down, it was massive, it did not even stay up! I have no idea how it can be classed as a ‘size 8.’ Having spoke to several others and looking on second hand selling sites, it seems everyone has had sizing issues, with 100% of the people I’ve spoke to saying they’re returning or selling on because it’s too big. Of course this happens sometimes and every brand is different. However, when trying to return, I realised how disingenuous this company really is which was soo disappointing. Not only do you have to pay for your own postage, you have to pay premium prices as the brand refuse to absorb costs if the package is lost and the only way of getting money back would be compensation from Royal Mail? Just found this very strange and made the experience more bitter, paying £13.40 to return a dress:/ I’ve also read countless reviews about how long refunds take, if you even get it at all, so it’ll be interesting to see how long this takes. Again, I know they’re a smaller company and this might be the reason for this but it does feel like they don’t care about their customers enough to offer a stress free returns experience. It’s a shame as the sizing issue probably wouldn’t have stuck with me whereas this will and I probably won’t order again.	2023-05-24	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/647085d978cb064305af3554	0.016693121693121697	neutral	["size", "ordered", "sizing", "would", "really", "despite", "dress", "found", "small", "even"]

6845	oddmuselondon	Kiki	I’ve made 3 orders from odd muse over the last two - three months and I’m generally just fed up now. 1. First order - was smooth. I ordered a full suit and I loved it, I paid for next day delivery. It arrived on time. No issues. This encouraged me to purchase again, then the issues started: 2. I ordered the ultimate muse blazer dress, they sent me the ultimate muse pearl dress. I was annoyed  as I had purchased it for a work event, but I thought whatever. I was told to send the item back and provide them with proof and I would receive confirmation of the correct dress being sent. I sent them confirmation. I received no confirmation back. I did get the dress the next day. But the entire thing was annoying. But hey mistakes occur. I wanted to send it back as I didn’t like it but I read through the previous trust pilot reviews and saw returns can be an issue and I’m a trainee accountant so I have 0 time on my hands. So I have just donated it instead. 3. I thought oh that was just a mistake. I’ll make another purchase. I purchased the ultimate muse jumpsuit. I paid for next day delivery. I received standard delivery. I spoke to them and they said it was another mistake. So they refunded me my delivery fee. I was going to Paris, so I delayed my ticket/ hotel by a day (which I could only do due to my boyfriends job) so I could stay for delivery as I knew we wouldn’t back for a while and the weather is unpredictable. I received the jumpsuit. Didn’t like it so sent it back for an exchange for another blazer using next day delivery. It’s been 9 working days since they received the jumpsuit and still no blazer. I’ve had to chase them. Comment on TikTok and instagram etc after I sent an email which I understand that issues sometimes occur. However, constant issues like this, that result in me having to waste time that I genuinely don’t have to chase  up really sours the entire buying process. I genuinely don’t have it in me anymore. I do my part as a customer, I purchase the item for the price that they set. I don’t haggle. All I want is a smooth process in return. It’s honestly one of the reasons I’ve decided to stop buying at small businesses. The items may be good but the service is so unpredictable and is often more of a headache than a joy.	2023-04-28	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/645e1f05bb2d98977f52d761	0.08270833333333336	neutral	["delivery", "day", "sent", "back", "muse", "next", "issues", "dress", "received", "time"]

6856	oddmuselondon	Madison Cope	I recently had the pleasure of shopping with Odd Muss, and I must say, I was blown away by the quality, style, and design of the dress I received.First and foremost, the cut and shape of the dress are simply impeccable. The flared skirt provides a fun and flirty feel, while the square neckline adds a touch of sophistication and elegance.The pearl detailing on the dress is what truly sets it apart. The pearls are delicately placed throughout the neckline and skirt, adding a touch of glamour and refinement to the overall design. The pearls are securely attached to the dress, ensuring that they won't fall off or become loose over time.The quality of the dress is top-notch as well. The fabric is sturdy and substantial, yet still soft and comfortable to wear. The dress is fully lined, ensuring that it lays smoothly on the body without any unwanted bunching or clinging. The stitching and construction of the dress are excellent, indicating that this is a garment that will last for many wears to come.Overall, I would highly recommend shopping with OddMuse. The prices are worth it due to the attention to detail and quality that truly sets this dress apart and justifies its price point. Fast fashion is out, invest in your wardrobe!! Odd Muse’s styles are the perfect combination of fun and elegance, and you are sure to be a showstopper at any event. I had a seamless experience with OddMuse &  I will definitely be a returning customer!	2023-04-24	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64467756df46c77ca25a87f4	0.26748974358974353	neutral	["dress", "quality", "shopping", "odd", "design", "skirt", "fun", "neckline", "touch", "truly"]

6902	oddmuselondon	Nicole Jacobs	The dress was truly beautiful!! I was a little unsure on the sizing, but ended up sizing up to a medium.

I think tape on the shoulders would have been helpful too but didn’t think of in time! I am 135 5’3 and a C cup. A small may have been a bit snug and I was happy with my size.

6917	oddmuselondon	Katie greer	I placed an order for the pearl black dress in a size large, when the dress came it was good quality, but the sizing is completely off. The dress was significantly too small so I re-ordered the same dress in an extra large and had the same problem with it being significantly smaller. I am usually a large in most places so was very disheartening to find how small it was. Then when I returned the items odd Muse deducted £26, so £13 from each order off my refund which I think is a large amount of money to take from customers considering the high price tag and the poor sizing.	2023-02-06	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64060f068de412ed344f8f82	0.08730576441102758	neutral	["dress", "large", "order", "sizing", "significantly", "small", "placed", "pearl", "black", "size"]
6918	oddmuselondon	Robyn	I got the blazer to wear to work. I had to return it because the button didn't fasten right (too low, on me anyway), and I did thing the belt was a bit too small to tie round the front properly. That being said, you can tell its a good quality blazer, very heavy, thick material. Despite this being indicative of good quality, I did decide not to buy the bigger size (I originally bought the S, and I am an 8-10) because I thought I would get too hot wearing it in summer.Didn't love having to pay for returns, but its a small brand so that's not a problem. It was my own fault for not checking (or anticipating the return). Overall, I would try Odd Muse again in future. Perhaps the jumpsuit.	2023-03-06	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/640606d24c9b65fea3f1cf88	0.1102248677248677	neutral	["blazer", "return", "small", "good", "quality", "would", "got", "wear", "work", "button"]

6920	oddmuselondon	Michelle	Purchased a dress I had been wanting for a while- sizing was way off (2-3 sizes different than marked- the website lets you shop in US sizes so it was not a conversion issue) . Item was eligible for return so I paid $70 to USPS to ship back to the UK.  When it arrived they rejected it so now I don't have a dress and am out almost $300.  No customer service phone number.

6927	oddmuselondon	Becca	I got the viral pearl dress in white on pre-order. Delivery was quick once the release date rolled around and the quality of the dress was incredible, especially given the price tag. However, I was disappointed to try it on and find the shoulders slipping off and the chest area was really constricted (although I have read they will bring out different chest sizes for bigger busts...). I feel like it is made for a very specific body shape and doesn't take into account smaller frames for the shoulders or those with larger busts. It was also quite short.I had to return the dress which was easy to do and I was refunded quickly. This hasn't put me off ordering other outfits from OddMuse in the future, but they need to be more inclusive with their sizing of this dress in particular, especially when it comes to showing pictures of different sized models wearing the clothes and not just their founder	2023-01-20	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63ff4bc2e0e67e095eff335f	0.09458333333333334	neutral	["dress", "especially", "shoulders", "chest", "different", "busts", "got", "viral", "pearl", "white"]

6935	oddmuselondon	Customer review	The dress did not arrive on time and was delayed in being shipped out. In addition to this the sizing wasn’t standard on the bust versus the arms and bodice. I then had my item returned through tracked postage. I contacted odd muse to let them know that tracking was showing the courier attempted to deliver to the address as per the refund document on their website. Odd muse replied saying I should contact the courier so they can reattempt delivery - which is ridiculous because the courier left a note stating where odd muse can collect the package or how to have it delivered again to an alternative address. It is not good enough for a business to not accept deliveries at the business address it provides and then tells a customer it’s their job to contact the courier so it can be re delivered. Still waiting to hear back from odd muse after I informed them they need to contact the courier on the details left for them. Steer clear as delivery isn’t on time and clearly customer service for refunds isn’t a priority for this business despite their items being pricey.	2023-02-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63f542326f3134764b70868e	-0.08846153846153844	neutral	["courier", "odd", "muse", "address", "contact", "business", "time", "delivery", "left", "delivered"]

6937	oddmuselondon	Ella Burnham	I own a few products from Oddmuse including their Ultimate Muse blazer, and all products are made to the highest quality and fit like a glove. The blazer is my most worn item because it is so versatile and such a statement piece. I’ve worn it to work, on date nights, on holiday and it always gets so many compliments. Their leather trousers are also extremely flattering as they’re high waisted, and made from amazing vegan leather. On top of having amazing products, their customer service is 10/10, and I feel great buying and supporting an independent brand, rather than fast fashion who may sell similar products but nowhere near the same quality!	2023-02-20	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63f3a9169b64b1bdaf5d4934	0.2571052631578947	neutral	["products", "blazer", "made", "quality", "worn", "leather", "amazing", "oddmuse", "including", "ultimate"]

6943	oddmuselondon	Francine Collis	I do not write reviews often, but I really feel the need to share my truly awful experience in the hope the brand will sort out their issues and other customers are warned in advance what they will have to deal with. I ordered two sizes of the black pearl dress (as I didn't know which size I would be). Unfortunately, neither of the dresses fitted properly are the sizing around the shoulders is really large, so I had to send both dresses back.I returned the parcels with Royal Mail tracked and received an email from Royal Mail to say this was delivered to Odd Muse on 12th January. It got to 2nd February and I still hadn't received notification from Odd Muse that they had received my parcel, let alone processed my refund, so I emailed them. I allowed 24 hours for a response, before messaging them on Instagram. They asked for my order number, which I then gave them, and then they never responded. 24 hours later I messaged to ask for an update, and again didn't get a response, but had read my messages. After a further 24 hours I decided to comment on one of their posts, explaining that I had emailed them and messaged them on Instagram and been ignored on both platforms. Odd Muse deleted this comment(!!!) and messaged me back on Instagram asking if I had tried emailing them and to wait 10 days for a refund. I explained I had emailed them 4 days ago and had no response and that it had been almost 4 weeks since the parcel was delivered to them. They read the message, and did not reply. Another 24 hours passed, I asked for an update, they read the message, and did not reply (as you can imagine I was extremely frustrated by this point as I am £250 out of pocket!).I messaged again later that day expressing my frustration, saying that they keep offering to look into my order number but then reading my message and not replying. They responded to this message saying their team are processing refunds today and to keep an eye out on emails. Another 24 hours passed, no email. I messaged them on Instagram asking if they can look into my specific order number since they keep offering to, but every time I send my order number, they read the message and don't reply. Another 24 hours pass, no reply. I then message again to explain how much I am in disbelief that they are reading my messages and not replying when I have been waiting 4 weeks for a refund and I am £250 out of pocket. They do reply to this asking for my tracking number with Royal Mail, which I send over to them. They ask me wait until the end of the next day while they look into my order. The next day, Odd Muse message me on Instagram to say they have issued my refund that morning which I should have received notification of. I check my emails, no email. I respond to say I haven't yet received an email but I look forward to it coming through. Another 24 hours pass, no email. So I have to chase again to say I still haven't yet received the email I should've had yesterday morning to say my order has been refunded. Fortunately, the email then comes through after this message and I have now been refunded for the two dresses.They explained during these complaints that it seems the dress must have been lost in transit as they cannot find it (even thought Royal Mail marked this as delivered). I offered to submit a complaint for them to mark the post as lost, which they read and did not reply. Fair enough if you're not bothered about the lost dresses, but at least reply to thank me for offering to help them surely???Last, but definitely not least, I obviously paid to return the dresses as I expected to as they outline this on their website. However, they deducted the original postage from my return, even though I returned the whole order!!! I'm not sure they are aware the seller has to refund the delivery charge if you return the whole order, but knowing full well that they read my messages and don't respond even when I want to help them, I can't be bothered to go through the frustration of seeing them read my messages and not respond to me again. It is such a shame that I feel the need to leave this bad review, as I have only ever left positive trust pilot reviews before, but I have never had such appalling customer service from a brand before and I don't want someone else to go through what I have been through.	2023-02-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63e62fef745e480021a0c1cf	-0.036279164149803686	neutral	["order", "message", "email", "hours", "read", "reply", "received", "say", "refund", "instagram"]
6944	oddmuselondon	Anonymous	The sizing on the pearl dress is horrific. As a size 6-8 usually and standing at 5”5 i first bought the XS, this would not fit so i then bought the small (barely any difference between the two) so i have had to order the medium. This should be made clearer, especially when the returns policy is so difficult. The zip on the dress also is very stiff and even when it was not on was sometimes hard to zip up. I would understand if i wasn’t paying a lot but when its over £100 for a dress+ 4.50 delivery you would expect to be offered free returns.	2023-02-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63e40f8a9b64b1bdaf514752	-0.18820346320346318	negative	["dress", "would", "bought", "returns", "zip", "sizing", "pearl", "horrific", "size", "usually"]

6950	oddmuselondon	simmy	The Pearl dress is pretty and good material and the shipping came quickly. However, the fit of the dress is really poor. I’m convinced it’s made for people who are sized between 6-8. I am size UK 10 and I ordered a black Pearl in 2XXL (UK size 16-18) after reading reviews and seeing TikTok's etc about needing to size up I panicked and ordered the largest size just to be foolproof. However, it still did not go up. Which is very disappointing as this is the largest size they offer. And if it is not fitting my body type then, that is quite concerning. For the price point too I was expecting more. I don’t even have a big chest size either I’m only an A cup. Garments needs to be measured correctly.Needless to say my self esteem has gone out of the window.	2023-01-13	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63c18f634d0773066a372c4f	0.053333333333333316	neutral	["size", "pearl", "dress", "however", "ordered", "largest", "pretty", "good", "material", "shipping"]

6954	oddmuselondon	Samantha McEwan	LOVE OddMuse! My partner bought me their famous pearl dress for Christmas, after weeks of lusting after it and deciding I had to have it for NYE.He bought it on pre-order for despatch December 5th. It took 2 days to ship and communication was great the whole time. Couldn’t have been happier with the process.I’ve seen some reviews on here with negative comments about the sizing, which I find confusing. I’m a size 10 and ordered an M as instructed by the size guide, and the fit was perfect! I get that the size range isn’t the most extensive, but the dress was true to size. I’m 5’7-5’8 and found the length fine, it might be a little on the short side for taller gals, but I saw a comment from a 5’10 girl on insta saying she let the hem down and it was fine - so there are solutions!The fabric is thick and really great quality, the pearls stitched on securely and it is genuinely one of the most flattering pieces I’ve ever owned. It makes your waist look teeny! I felt truly fabulous for my New Year celebrations.If you’re considering buying something from OddMuse, definitely go for it, you won’t regret it!	2022-12-05	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63b225e32338b6d417ad1b71	0.2802767255892256	neutral	["size", "oddmuse", "bought", "dress", "great", "fine", "love", "partner", "famous", "pearl"]
6955	oddmuselondon	Sarah Cooper	SIZING and RETURNSI recently ordered the pearl dress for NYE but unfortunately had to return the dress due to sizing. I am a size uk 14, so initially ordered an XL and then an XXL, neither ended up fitting. I do have a larger sized chest 36DD, I feel this is the reason for the dress not fitting. I think it would be good if there were more specific measurements, like for waist, chest and hips. The sizing overall is not very exclusive, with the XXL being similar in size to a UK 12. The company does not use a return service, I found it quite complicated to get it back to them but this may be due to my location.	2022-12-26	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63b161424d0773066a2ab4d7	0.006249999999999999	neutral	["sizing", "dress", "ordered", "return", "due", "size", "xxl", "fitting", "chest", "returnsi"]

6967	oddmuselondon	Emily	I’m never really one to post reviews but I feel like I have to in this situation. Ordered two items (including a pre-order of the Pearl dress) from Odd Muse on Nov 1st, with a delivery date of Nov 20th. Two days after the advised delivery date had passed, I got an email saying it was delayed until Dec 5th - which meant it would arrive after the party that I needed the dress for - but we move. In my order I also purchased an item that was in stock, so I paid for 48hr shipping assuming this item would be delivered separately. It wasn’t and my request for a refund on the shipping has been rejected multiple times. Maybe don’t offer people express shipping where it’s not available???When my order finally arrived, the sizing was a total disappointment - firstly, any brand advertising a size 16 as XXL needs to short themselves out. Secondly, the dress was not size 16 - it runs extremely small. I would say it was a 14 at a push. I promptly returned my order, paying out of my own pocket (again) for 24hr tracked shipping, as is requested by Odd Muse. They also expect you to have access to a printer to print your own order return note which is pretty bizarre in 2022.I returned my order on December 11th and it arrived with Odd Muse on December 13th. They advised on trustpilot that returns are processed twice weekly but I have received no refund of the almost £300 that I spent on my order and it’s now a week later. Since then, I’ve emailed the company 4 times and have received no response or update on my refund. I really have never been so, so disappointed in a brand across the board with regards to sizing and inclusivity, reliability and general customer service.Do not shop here!	2022-11-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63a17f0c2338b6d417a15d41	0.0027173913043478273	neutral	["order", "shipping", "dress", "odd", "muse", "would", "refund", "never", "really", "two"]

6971	oddmuselondon	Gemma	I have mixed feelings about my experience. I wanted to love the brand and the clothes. I ordered the Black Pearl Dress on pre order, to be delivered on or before the 5th December, I also ordered a blazer at the same time (which was in stock). I paid for next day delivery, knowing this would get my items to be for the 5th December. I emailed a couple of times and have to say, I never had an issue getting a response. I emailed on the 1st December to just see if there was any updates as I was hoping to wear the items that weekend, I asked at this point if the order could be spilt so I could get the Blazer, even if I wouldn't get the dress, I offered to pay an extra delivery charge for this. I got a dispatch email on the 1st December with a tracking number, so I thought everything was on track. Until I kept tracking my order and it just said, Royal Mail is waiting to receive the parcel from the sender.I got a reply on the 5th December saying that all items would be sent together and if I wanted to reorder the blazer to be sent separate I could and that my order would be with my by the 15th December. Obviously I was a bit confused as I'd ordered it as guaranteed by the 5th and I had multiple events I wanted to wear the items for, plus I'd received a tracking number, anyway I emailed back and explained my confusion. They did refund my shipping charge and I got another dispatch email on the 12th December (Royal Mail were on strike the 13th and 14th), I was loosing hope on ever receiving the order, however it did arrive on the 16th December (a full month after I ordered and 9 working days after the guaranteed delivery date). Now I know Royal Mail was on strike, but the order even though a tracking number had been generated was never actually dispatched. The clothes I have to say, quality wise are really good. The zip on the dress isn't great and really difficult to get up (where there is a cross over in the fabric - I ordered 2 sizes and it was difficult on both). The blazer is over sized, I probably should have sized down, but really didn't want to have to send it back and wait any longer, so kept the small. The dress is lovely, I ordered a S and a XS, I could get both on, but the chest on the XS was just to tight, the chest on the S is a little big, but a more comfortable fit. I would say the dress is low cut, lower than I was expecting, but it is beautiful.As I ordered the dress in 2 sizes, I am having to return one. I've not read good reviews on the returns process.... so we'll see. One thing I would say, is I paid through Klarna, so I know I have a middle man if there are any issues. Overall the experience hasn't been great, but the clothes are lovely and I would shop again. Maybe just not over black Friday/Christmas.	2022-12-16	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63a0725c4d0773066a1e8b7b	0.12283891033891031	neutral	["december", "ordered", "dress", "order", "would", "get", "5th", "blazer", "items", "say"]

6975	oddmuselondon	Ada Zimny	Honestly, the dress I received is great quality, but the sizing is way off (too small) and returning is a less favorable experience here. I understand it’s a UK based brand, but the returns/exchange policy (actually just return policy since you can’t exchange it internationally) for international (US) is just sad. When all is said and done I would have to pay $100 for shipping charges……no dress is worth that. I was so excited to wear this on my trip and now i’m just disappointed. I guess it’s a lesson learned.	2022-12-13	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6398c167eb0ad8489909ec3a	0.03712121212121211	neutral	["dress", "policy", "honestly", "received", "great", "quality", "sizing", "way", "small", "returning"]

6978	oddmuselondon	Kay	One the best brands I’ve ever bought from. I don’t even just mean the product, but the customer service is absolutely fabulous. I stupidly did not realise my item was on preorder and when I emailed asking for its where abouts I was informed that it was indeed on preorder. However they still sent it out for me early, even though it was completely my fault. I have never known a brand to do this. And when it arrived I was even more happy, I absolutely love my blazer, a classic everyday staple but the most beautiful material and style. Not one bad thing to say. Will absolutely order over and over again.	2022-12-08	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/639373710b7fc02715d9e8fd	0.20694444444444446	neutral	["even", "absolutely", "one", "preorder", "best", "brands", "ever", "bought", "mean", "product"]
6979	oddmuselondon	Kori S	I got the pearl dress and it was even better in person! The dress was worth every penny. The quality is amazing, fits like a glove, and is beautiful!

6980	oddmuselondon	Emma-Jayne Smethurst	Ordered both the black and white Pearl dress as they are absolutely gorgeous and I couldn’t resist. The quality is so amazing, the kind of dress that will last a lifetime with countless wears and will always stay in style. The fit is great, even for bigger chests and I love the long sleeves and the fact it nips you in at the waist. I cannot wait to wear them all the time- will be a constant outfit repeat.

6990	oddmuselondon	Pia	If I could give this brand 0 stars I would. I have never in my life had to interact with such an incompetent company. It makes total sense why there is nowhere on their website to give a review. Keeping it short and simply:1. Sizing is completely off. Take about instagram versus reality, not sure how their models fit into the sizes they claim they’re fitting. Not sure if my childhood Barbie dolls could fit into this clothing. 2. Nothing they say is truthful. If you plan to order something for an upcoming event, I would highly suggest ordering it a month to 6 weeks before your event if you want it to arrive on time. 3. No one answers an email however they will actively post on social media instead! Clearly doesn’t value their actual consumers but values their likes on social media!4. Gooooood luck getting a refund when something doesn’t fit or doesn’t arrive on time!	2022-11-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/639104bd0b7fc02715d7b5aa	0.09731481481481483	neutral	["fit", "could", "give", "would", "sure", "something", "event", "arrive", "time", "social"]

I was very reluctant at first because of the price but the the quality of this dress is absolutely amazing and definitely justifies the price!!! I also really like how they’ve even taken the time to add grips on the inside of the shoulders so that they don’t fall down. I’ve worked in retail for a few years and worked with many expensive brands. In those years I have never seen quality as amazing as this Pearl dress before! Definitely worth the money.

However, we are now on day 16 with no response at all whilst they continue to promote new products.

I have tried to email 4 times over 3 weeks and have not heard back with a solution, I attached images of the product but then had no response at all. Very dissapointed. I am aware that is says they won’t refund items on sale but it’s not good quality and is faulty so surely an exception should be made?	2022-11-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/638e15825873c1cf9fcb9704	0.062159763313609465	neutral	["top", "quality", "purchased", "company", "sale\\u2026the", "received", "multiple", "loose", "threads", "hanging"]

When purchasing I did see the “pre-order” notice saying that it could take up to but no longer than 2 weeks to arrive. It has now been over a month with little to no communication from the customer service team. Many of my messages have been ignored until I felt the need to pester.

7013	oddmuselondon	Suzanne Koelewijn	Ordered the blazer after long hesitation because I really liked it. Unfortunately, the size guide on the website doesn't help very well because you also don't see all sizes in it when you click it next to the product. Ordered the blazer, paid shipping costs to the Netherlands and waited but..... after 3 days still no message that the package was sent. Immediately sent a message if it is ok and when I can expect it. Through live chat a few hours later I got a response that they could ship it that day. Very unfortunate that you have to send a message about this yourself. But I know how it is to work in the fashion world and do customer service so I kept calm and waited patiently. After 3 days the carrier came with a letter about import duties, this amount I also paid because I really wanted the blazer! There are also companies that put the packing slip at a lower price so that the customer does not have to pay import duties, but that is a matter for discussion.Well 300 euros later and the blazer finally arrived. I tried it on and even though I ordered my normal size as I found somewhere on social media, the blazer did not quite fit. The shoulders are very big but the waist is tighter. Since I wanted to put the large belt on anyway I thought it will be fine....But as indicated there are not many sizes to find on there website, and also no size of the belts you receive. And as expected the belt was much too short! How they tie the blazer on photos and videos is not how you get it done if you are a size L.... While I do have a slim waist. I always trust companies and for that reason I sent a message via Instagram, the website chat feature and a question sticker on Instagram if I did receive the correct penny or if it belongs to a different size blazer. NEVER HAD A RESPONSE.... After a week of waiting and no response just opted to return the blazer but that too is a disaster after paying import duties and having to return it myself without the help of a return portal or anything like that..... Now kept the blazer but hoping to sell it at a loss to someone else because I'm never going to be able to wear it myself without the right centerpiece....Very unfortunate that after having so much confidence in a company you are not helped further but see pictures, videos and TikTok's all over the place. Maybe invest more time and money in a better customer service team, better customer service support? Better website with more information? Then in all the marketing they do....A disappointed customer still waiting for response.	2022-09-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/633ec863350baeeabe627cef	0.09913419913419913	neutral	["blazer", "size", "customer", "website", "also", "message", "response", "ordered", "sent", "service"]

7033	oddmuselondon	Delma Jones	So I’m a curvy lady with a small waist, big hip and big thighs with large breasts. The garment I ordered was a jump suit while it fitted on the bottom half it didn’t fit on the top half as it was far too big (despite big breasted) the other issue was the belt it came with was far too small and clearly the belt was ‘one size fits all’. Again despite having a small waist it still didn’t fit… I ordered a two different sizes and neither fitted and the belt was missing on one of the sizes. On returning I was disappointed that there wasn’t a free returns. The only positive I can give was that the material was beautiful. Loved the style etc but disappointed that it simply didn’t fit. Clearly designed for a seize 6/8 but trying to sell to a larger lady like myself (16/18) with no consideration to my sort of body shape or size. It also cost a fortune to send the items back!	2022-07-21	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d96ae58000af4a8846d86d	0.039440836940836936	neutral	["big", "small", "belt", "lady", "waist", "ordered", "fitted", "half", "fit", "far"]

7038	oddmuselondon	Veronica Oda Karoline Henrichs	Overall great experience. The quality of the fabric and design have been amazing for all pieces that I’ve purchased. I’ve bought all their blazers, shorts and trousers, and I’m in absolute love. Sooo flattering and nice. I once bought their jumpsuit, unfortunately it was impossible to get the flaps at the top to stay put even with the belt. I’m a C-cup, and wears a size small. Therefor I had to return it. Since I had to pay a lot for returning the item, that unfortunately weren’t perfectly designed for bigger breasts, I give Oddmuse 4 out of 5. I lost a lot of money having to return something I could never wear. With that being said. I recommend this brand hugely. I’ll continue to purchase their future pieces.	2022-07-21	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d964ab8000af4a8846d069	0.1788888888888889	neutral	["pieces", "bought", "unfortunately", "return", "lot", "overall", "great", "experience", "quality", "fabric"]
7039	oddmuselondon	LS	Having had a poor experience previously, I was left with a gift card. So why not spend it? I purchased some trousers. These arrived with the seem not fully stitched so I returned (simple?!?) Again the disappointment of paying for returns but understand why they have this as a rule. After a few days I had the trousers returned back to me, so resent with a covering letter explaining they arrived faulty. Have now received an email, saying no refund will be issued. They cannot provide any evidence as to why I cannot return other then the below. “All items go through quality check control before being sent out to customers therefor we have to assume that this rip was caused either when the garment was being tried on or when worn. We also believe if there was a faulty issue with the garment the customer would flag this issue to us straight away so we are made aware,before sending this back to us”Really disappointed AGAIN as I gave benefit of the doubt……. But I never wore this item but being told they will not let me return even though they sent me a faulty item.	2022-07-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d042fd8000af4a88402ca8	-0.18560606060606058	negative	["faulty", "trousers", "arrived", "returned", "back", "return", "sent", "garment", "issue", "item"]
7040	oddmuselondon	Cameron I	I got the Wrap jumpsuit. It is really gorgeous and has a mix of elegant office and Star Wars vibes which is brilliant. However, they should consider a little invisible button where the front wrap is to hold the wrap in place for the larger breasted women. I am a 30/32D and i found myself having to check quite frequently. They are pricey; so they should also consider breaking down their carbon footprint/cost of production etc to value the pricing if they don’t already like other sustainable and ethical higher priced brands :)	2022-05-17	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6283b0e84b16276ac9881797	0.24381313131313131	neutral	["wrap", "consider", "got", "jumpsuit", "really", "gorgeous", "mix", "elegant", "office", "star"]

7051	oddmuselondon	Abi Badmus	I have two of the Odd Muse trousers and a blazer dress. Having lost a shed load of weight recently I have decided to move away from fast fashion and focus on buying items built to last. The trousers are amazing. AMAZING. They cinch you in beautifully and are cut so well. I decided on the dress over the blazer as I figured it would be more versatile (I’d have loved to buy both) and zero regrets. Because of my weight loss I am in between sizes. I have had to return and exchange items a good few times. It’s allbeen done super efficiently (you have to pay to return but bear no shipping costs if exchanging). The parcels have come back with a hand written notice which is a lovely touch. Overall, great clothes, especially for someone like me who is still finding her feet with fashion. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.	2022-02-02	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/61fa8f1ea16c1e751f7c3465	0.2953703703703703	neutral	["trousers", "blazer", "dress", "weight", "decided", "fashion", "items", "amazing", "return", "two"]

7055	oddmuselondon	Dieu Linh	I’ve been following OddMuse since it launched and it took a year to finally make a purchase. There was a generous gifting offer with every order that included the planner so i couldn’t miss out! I decided to purchase the leather pants as I don’t own a pair. Delivery was quite quick considering I purchased them just before Xmas. My planner has been put to good use everyday, and it’s been helping me organise my goals. Unfortunately, the leather pants did have a hole in them which I hadn’t realised when I put them on. I’m very slim/petite so I was very skeptical on whether I had ripped them or if it arrived damaged as I never Inspected them beforehand. I was directed on insta to email them regarding my faulty item, and was very happy with the response. They happily accepted an exchange for a new one as I genuinely loved the fit of the leather pants. The delivery was kindly paid for, and received a new pair within a week. I’m delighted, and just wore them today. I made sure to check everything, and can say I’m very pleased :) I have purchased and donated leather pants from other brands many times because I would hate the fit/material. These are genuinely comfortable, and I hope they will last me a VERY long time. I also like that they don’t look baggy around my knees. Can’t wait to take a photo in them ! Thank you OddMuse Team.

7069	houseofcb	Ruth Francis	UPDATE: Been sent into admin hell with this. It seems there is no way to claim a refund. The way House of CB is set up is that they make it impossible to claim a refund and must be making millions of this type of theft. Don't buy from House of CB. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm 27 waist 34 bust. This means that a House of CB size small should fit. I ordered a small dress, it was no where near the zip being able to be pulled up. I sent it back but have been offered a gift certificate instead of a refund. This makes no sense. There's also press about this dress being too small in it's sizing. They make a false claim on their website saying "Full refund If you don’t love your purchase* Also on the "contact" page there is no way to contact them as this type of query isn't handled.I would like a refund, not a gift ceritficate as I wouldn't buy for House of CB again as their dress quality is poor and sizing faulty.	2025-07-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68716510df6961f684e84f4d	0.0006410256410256345	neutral	["refund", "house", "way", "claim", "small", "dress", "sent", "make", "type", "buy"]
7070	houseofcb	JZ	I returned a dress due to it being lopsided/ it slanted to the left completely and the waist area was droopy. The customer service team said I could exchange the item but would have to pay for the return shipping of the item myself and I would be reimbursed the shipping cost if the returns team could confirm it was really a "manufacturing default". I sent the dress back a day later and had to keep reaching out to customer service for updates on my exchange and shipping refund. It took around 1.5 months for the team to accept/ acknowledge my dress was indeed "faulty" and agree to refund my return shipping cost. Then the team said I could only receive my refunded shipping cost as a $25 gift card/ store credit OR give them my BANK ACCOUNT details for a bank transer.So I sent over the requested information they asked for: bank name, account number, account holder name, sort cord, routing number.A week later I get refunded to my ORIGINAL CREDIT CARD that I paid with. Seems very sketchy that they acted like a credit card refund was not possible and asked for all my bank details/ personal information for a bank transfer that never even happened...VERY sketchy	2025-07-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/686ebbfd1b94795a0ef42074	0.0625	neutral	["shipping", "bank", "team", "dress", "could", "cost", "refund", "card", "credit", "account"]
7071	houseofcb	Emily Atkinson	Shocking Trustpilot score and untrustworthy customer service. This retailer advises customers to buy with specific advice and reference to my measurements, then when I pointed out a flaw in the dress and it’s stitching, they pretended it was my non-standard measurements - when I am literally their exact online standard for a size small, regular cup. Wasted my time asking for photos and when I prove the issues with the dress (asymmetrical wonky stitching, gaping, poor manufacture) they try and make out even their cookie cutter customers are “non standard.” So apparently I am ineligible for my refund. DEFINITELY a pattern of behaviour from them and a go-to line. Avoid avoid avoid. Oh Polly offered far better customer service and quality of stitching. Do NOT buy the Charmaine, and do NOT shop here!	2025-07-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/686e49ac00d6c235de4fd93e	-0.08035714285714284	neutral	["stitching", "avoid", "customer", "service", "customers", "buy", "measurements", "dress", "standard", "shocking"]

7076	houseofcb	Tara Jade Fitzgerald	TLDR: They lie to avoid refunds, ignore your legal rights, and their customer service is absolutely awful. Avoid this company.I returned a dress to House of CB that had a small hole in the seam under the zip – clearly a manufacturing fault. I never wore it. I noticed the issue the day before I was meant to wear it to a wedding, and sent it back exactly as they sent it to me: unworn, with all ribbons and tags still attached.It was a week outside their 28-day return policy, but that doesn’t matter- under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, if an item is faulty, I’m entitled to a repair or replacement, and if that isn’t suitable, I can request a refund. These rights apply even if the item has been worn- but in my case, it hadn’t been worn.They refused a refund and said they could only offer a repair, due to claiming the dress had been worn and returned without the tags and ribbons- which is a blatant lie. I returned it exactly as it arrived. It honestly feels like they’ve made that up to justify only offering a repair.I told them a repair wasn’t suitable as the event had passed, and I clearly outlined my legal right to refuse a repair for that reason. They ignored that, went ahead and repaired the dress anyway, and then sent it back to me.I refused the delivery- because why would I accept the item back after they claimed it had been worn and was missing tags and ribbons? No thank you.Since then, I’ve asked where the dress is now and been completely ignored. So right now, they have the dress, I have no refund, and I’m stuck going back and forth over email with a customer service team that won’t answer direct questions, ignores my statutory rights, and just repeats vague responses.They keep referring to their internal policy as if that overrides UK consumer law- it absolutely doesn't. TLDR: They lie to avoid refunds, ignore your legal rights, and their customer service is absolutely awful. Avoid this company.	2025-07-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68656a641dac286272b24d5f	0.013214285714285727	neutral	["rights", "dress", "avoid", "back", "repair", "lie", "legal", "customer", "service", "absolutely"]

I’d need to get a size 14 as a 8/10 just for their dress to fit me.

7081	houseofcb	Monica Sartori	If I could give this company a ZERO review then I would. I ordered the same dress in two sizes for my daughter at a cost of £219 per dress. I received the first one and it was a perfect fit. When the second one arrived a few days later, we knew we needed to return it and it arrived WITHOUT ANY SECURITY RIBBON ON IT and looking a bit crumpled. My heart sunk as it states about the security ribbon needing to be on it and so I immediately emailed the company to let them know at their returns address and I heard nothing. I then returned the item and waited and waited and did not receive a refund or any comms until I chased them 12 working days later again via numerous channels to which I had NO REPLY. Then they have eventually answered via Facebook messenger to say they cannot refund as it didn't have a security ribbon on it and appeared worn! I know this as I had LET THEM KNOW when I received it. My daughter has still not worn her actual dress that we kept as her prom is next week. Let alone wearing the dress that didn't actually fit her! I am so upset and stressed and she is also upset as she knows the dress cost a lot of money and was really grateful that I had purchased it for her as she has been having a tough time...I cannot afford to fork out for two dresses, one of which doesn't even fit her and which i no longer even have in my possession. It's bad enough having to do a tracked return for the dress. I would just like to SPEAK to someone rather than deal with continuous chat bots.	2025-06-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68514aa6b3068a45ae7575e4	0.08594771241830067	neutral	["dress", "one", "fit", "security", "ribbon", "let", "know", "company", "would", "two"]

7083	houseofcb	Alisa White	DO NOT SHOP HERE. The worst experience I have had with a clothes brand. I bought a dress for a work Christmas party online, I tried it on and instantly realised I didn’t like how it fitted me (very long corset and I have a short torso). I decided to return it, they tell you to pay for tracked shipping so I paid £17 to return the dress. It still had all tags and the ribbon as I hadn’t worn the dress for longer than 2 mins. I then received an email that they couldn’t refund me because the dress was “worn” and the ribbon was apparently tampered with. Obviously I was shocked, this dress was £189 plus I had paid for express shipping as I needed it quickly, I then paid a lot to return it back to them. I could not believe they were trying to say I had worn the dress, unless of course you are not allowed to try on the dress. Anyway, I contacted their customer service who essentially pass you from person to person. There is no phone number as obviously they know that they are committing a scam. You email them and a different person replies each time. I escalated this to a senior manager who takes days to reply and copies/pastes without responding to any questions. It was literally like speaking to a bot. House of CB then sent me the dress back, a dress that doesn’t fit me as it’s too big and the quality isn’t great (mesh sleeves fall down). I should have returned it in store as they are real people, if you are returning do it in store otherwise you will be stuck and have to keep the item. I am now down over £200 and stuck with a dress I cannot wear. I did some research and this is something they do often, if a style is going to be discontinued soon they stop refunding items and accuse the customer of showing signs of wear. It’s pretty effective as there’s no way of getting your money back because they put you through bot after bot until you get so exhausted.	2024-12-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/684d9f12ae0fa2180ccb7bcc	0.006835748792270533	neutral	["dress", "return", "paid", "worn", "back", "person", "bot", "like", "shipping", "ribbon"]

Good companies are at least willing to consider exceptions to their policy if a request is reasonable.

7087	houseofcb	customer	I’ve been buying some House of CB dresses and corsets for a friend as gifts and we have become more disillusioned with each order.Sizing is inconsistent between various different designs. Larger cup sizes don’t fit adequately. Lace-up styles don’t have sufficient additional length to allow for a good custom fit.Customer Service is just non-existent. Something one would expect at the price point these items are. Replies to emails never materialize. Response on FB or X is sporadic at best.Shipping has also become abysmal with all packages now being shipped “restricted delivery” meaning one can’t use delivery manager to schedule a time convenient for the customer, or have them shipped to a FedEx office for pickup. And shipping is now ground too, not 2-3 days air as touted.For a company to expect their customer to wait around all day to sign for a package is insane. House of CB should take a lesson from Selkie, Zimmerman, and other designers that treat their customers well.	2025-05-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/683bac70f550b8c55704b069	0.08981481481481482	neutral	["house", "become", "one", "expect", "shipped", "delivery", "customer", "buying", "dresses", "corsets"]

7096	houseofcb	lyna benchoubane	I’m extremely disappointed. I paid €300 for your Cesca dress in pink (order 8968319), which just arrived damaged — there are visible holes near the seam. I was counting on this dress for a wedding this Thursday, and now I’m left without an outfit for a very important event. For a brand that markets itself as high-end, this is unacceptable.I’ve asked for a full refund or an urgent replacement, and I will only consider updating or removing this comment if you respond quickly and resolve this situation positively.	2025-05-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/682b6de3342c6e72b8e89b96	0.07562289562289562	neutral	["dress", "extremely", "disappointed", "paid", "\\u20ac300", "cesca", "pink", "order", "8968319", "arrived"]
7097	houseofcb	Isabella Troy	I genuinely could not recommend this company less.I ordered the Mademoiselle dress ahead of my Law Society admission ceremony. It cost nearly £200 but I thought to hell with it, it’s a once in a lifetime occasion.First red flag was that arrived in an objectively too small box so was going to need steaming.Second red flag? An oil-y mark on the bodice and some pilling to the fabric. Boyfriend thought it looked like someone had eaten curry in it then tried to blot it away. I ordered the dress in light blue so the mark was very noticeable.I had tried the dress on and noticed the stain with 15 minutes of receiving it so I immediately emailed the ‘hello,houseofcb’ email address with photographs and videos.You’d think a brand holding itself out as luxury would have some kind of automated response email to acknowledge traffic in but no, they don’t.I emailed again the next day as I was in a panic with it being such an expensive dress and nothing. Was then advised by their instagram team that each new email resets their 48 hour reply period so I held off.I didn’t get an email back until nearly 3 days later. The customer service agent who emailed advised their email policy includes a 24 hour reply period, conflicting with what the instagram team told me.They offered to pay to dry clean the dress, up to £25 OR I could return the dress for an exchange, they would inspect it and if it was a manufacturer defect they would reimburse my shipping up to £20.I tried to query what would constitute a manufacturing default as to me it looked like a stain not a defect but was told that would be down to the returns team. I was worried about the potential that dry cleaning wouldn’t be successful, and didn’t want to accept a marked dress so returned it for an exchange. I paid £10 for next day shipping.It took them 5 days from receipt of my item to tell me that they would exchange it but that they couldn’t refund my shipping as it wasn’t a manufacturer fault.I queried why I should bare responsibility when the item was clearly received in poor condition, given the evidence I’d provided regarding timing etc (I had a video of the dress with marks on at 10.19, I received it at 10.16). They told me it’s an unusual case that they’re investigating with their warehouse team.I’ve asked them why that falls within my responsibility and have had no response.I would expect a brand charging nearly £200 for a dress to go above and beyond in terms of customer service. They’re far from a new company, they’re very well established, the very least they could do is send email acknowledgements and have a clear reply period policy.EDIT:After I queried what they meant by “unusual case” they told me that, as the stains were not manufacturing faults, the dress would have passed their quality checks and so they could not refund my postage. Essentially they were putting blame on me.I emailed back reiterating that I received the dress at 10.14 and had evidence of the staining at 10.16. I told them that they seem to treat their customers in two tiers (good service for influencers, poor for regular people) and that it’s beyond me why such a big brand cannot refund £10.79 when they’ve clearly messed up.Finally they agreed to refund my shipping costs but I cannot believe what a fight this has been.	2025-04-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/682a77d7a1aa1400af590c25	0.06467789001122336	neutral	["dress", "would", "email", "told", "could", "emailed", "refund", "nearly", "tried", "brand"]
7098	houseofcb	秦	I placed an order on their official website almost a month ago, and the item is still stuck with their shipping partner. I’ve reached out multiple times over the past week, but have received absolutely no response or support.It’s a very simple issue that could’ve been resolved quickly, but they just keep dragging it out with complete silence. Clearly, this brand is only focused on marketing and completely neglects after-sales service.I expected much better from a supposedly reputable company. If you care about customer service and accountability, I strongly suggest avoiding this brand. Very disappointing experience.	2025-04-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68267956083629da984901d0	0.05976190476190476	neutral	["brand", "placed", "order", "official", "website", "almost", "month", "ago", "item", "still"]
7099	houseofcb	Tudor Stoiean	I placed an order with House of CB and had to request a refund. Despite their policy clearly stating refunds are processed within 10 working days, it’s been well over that with zero resolution.Every time I follow up, they delay the process further by claiming “every new message resets the 24–48 hour response window.” This tactic is clearly designed to stall customers and avoid accountability. I’ve even been told they might have contacted the Oxford Street store, but no real update or action has followed.The customer service is painfully slow, vague, and unhelpful. There’s no direct phone number to call, no manager to speak to, and no commitment to actually resolving the issue.At this point, I’m seeking legal action. Save yourself the stress and shop elsewhere. Overpriced items with underwhelming service.	2025-04-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68245af2bf383b7407152499	-0.017803030303030314	neutral	["clearly", "action", "service", "placed", "order", "house", "request", "refund", "despite", "policy"]
7100	houseofcb	Lils	I visited the Oxford Street store for a wedding guest dress, the staff were so rude to all customers, it came across that all of the customers were just annoying the staff! They’re trialling a new system to the changing rooms, and there was no clear signage or direction but they were allowing people to get to the front of the queue before telling them they had too many items and had to go to the back of a different one. When questioned by numerous other customers the staff were very dismissive, rude and patronising. Really disappointing to be treated like this by young girls in a store directed at other young girls! The girls have created a really intimidating atmosphere in that store, and it needs to be sorted. I went to the Selfridges House of CB department instead and was greeted by two of the most lovely, kind and positive staff members, a totally different experience!	2025-05-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6820e4a55cc31b5ca799d88d	0.028030303030303034	neutral	["staff", "store", "customers", "girls", "rude", "different", "really", "young", "visited", "oxford"]

7104	houseofcb	Lisa Lefèvre	I’ve ordered multiple pieces from House of CB, and honestly? They never disappoint. The quality is truly luxurious — thick, sculpting fabrics that feel amazing on the body and make you walk with just a little more confidence.What I especially love is the fit: their designs hug in all the right places and feel both sexy and elegant. I was a bit hesitant about the neutral tones at first, but now I’m obsessed. Their pieces have actually inspired me to explore softer, more natural colors — and I never thought I’d say that!Shipping is fast, sizing is consistent, and everything arrives beautifully packaged. I’d recommend House of CB to anyone looking for timeless, feminine pieces that make you feel incredible.	2025-05-04	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681d99878c4d2996e0bb0eee	0.3224107142857143	positive	["pieces", "feel", "house", "never", "make", "ordered", "multiple", "honestly", "disappoint", "quality"]
7105	houseofcb	CY	Be careful and don't take the bait!! The "deals" look good and thats how they get you! The size chart for the US is wildly inaccurate. They will take your money and then not help with a return or exchange if the item doesn't fit. This is probably the first experience I have ever had with a customer service department that has been this awful. They act like they are willing to help and then don't actually follow through. It's not just one rep either. You get passed around to 5 or 6 different people in a row. There is NO phone number to speak to anyone and you get a different person every email you send (even in the same email chain for the same concern). I have tried 5 different dresses from this company and the sizing is all over the place. Im typically an XS at 5 4" 135lbs-140lbs and I had to order a L in some of these dresses. Whereas some of their other styles, a small fit. Because of the extremely poor customer service and almost 100% probability I will need help again with sizing on each order (because their sizing charts are so inaccurate), I will not be ordering from them again. I regret my purchases terribly. There are plenty of other amazing dress stores out there to support by giving them my business.	2025-04-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/681a623486b32677e9c2aa8c	-0.01656746031746031	neutral	["get", "help", "different", "sizing", "dont", "take", "inaccurate", "fit", "customer", "service"]

So I ordered the S (reg cup) before sending back the M, in case it was too small. The Small arrived and it is perfect 👌 You have to push the waist material together to get the zip done up, but I managed it on my own.I have returned the M size using Royal Mail and received confirmation within 2 working days, and have received my refund.

7120	houseofcb	Nicola  Thomas	Long-Time Customer Let Down — £229 Refund Still MissingAfter being a loyal customer for years, I can sadly say I no longer trust this company.Their outdated returns process (reliant on paper slips) has finally failed me — and I’m now £229 out of pocket with no resolution in sight.Here’s what happened:I ordered two Gabbi gowns in size Small (one in Peach, one in Yellow). Both were too small, so I returned them and reordered the Yellow in a Medium. Before trying on the replacement, I found another dress elsewhere that I loved, so I returned the Medium Gabbi immediately. In total:\t•\tI bought 3 dresses\t•\tI returned 3 dresses\t•\tI’ve only been refunded for 2Customer service claims that my final return (the third parcel) contained a “flower dress” that didn’t match my returns slip. I’ve explained multiple times: I never ordered a flower dress — it’s not even an item I recognise. I have been emailing back and forth, passed between multiple agents, constantly repeating myself, with no sign of progress.It’s extremely frustrating, and I’m now exploring how to escalate this further through official consumer channels. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, I am entitled to a full refund for returned goods. This has not been honoured.This has been a disappointing and exhausting experience. Until this is resolved, I strongly advise others to avoid ordering. I certainly won’t be shopping here again.	2025-04-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6800262c842a4d87d4f91af0	-0.056984126984127	neutral	["returned", "dress", "customer", "\\u00a3229", "refund", "returns", "ordered", "gabbi", "small", "one"]

Based off of the experience alone with their wonderful customer service, I will not hesitate to order from House of CB in the future.	2025-04-14	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67fd35a9bd81c05ee6ca0f43	0.2314814814814815	neutral	["customer", "service", "fantastic", "attentive", "quick", "kind", "enough", "answer", "questions", "issued"]
7123	houseofcb	Robin Roosen	Bad experience. Ordered something for a lot of money, but very poor quality.

7124	houseofcb	Amber Wauterickx	Was excited to find that house of cb had very pretty dresses this year, so ordered a few in a couple of days time. First order came, one of the dresses had an obvious manufacturing fault, fabric was torn on multiple places. Second one was almost worse : following their sizing chart I am just a S, almost an XS. I could NOT fit in the dress, and it was not even a close call. Absolutely ridiculous and off size. Third dress came and was afwul quality and completely see trough. I contacted customer service for a return, and told them about the obvious defect one off the dresses had. I was told I had to return and if they considered it a manufacturing defect or broken, they would pay me back the shipping, which was €30!! After almost immediately returning, I saw on the tracking that it arrived about a week ago. Only today I got an e-mail stating that they received it and I would get payed back. However the shipping was not included, which is ridiculous since it clearly was a manufacturing mistake and they told me they would pay me back! Curious to see when the money will finally arrive on my bank account, since a lot of reviews state it takes super long. Overall I am mindblown how bad the quality and customer service is off this brand. It’s super expensive while the quality is no better than shein’s. Will never buy from here again, nor will I ever recommend this brand to anyone.	2025-04-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67f9631aee26928189f39703	-0.055	neutral	["dresses", "one", "manufacturing", "almost", "quality", "told", "would", "back", "came", "obvious"]

7126	houseofcb	Xelliq	If there's one thing you should know about this company: do NOT purchase anything from House of CB. I received a dress that arrived utterly defective. The skirt portion was constructed entirely lopsided, and I was appalled how this managed to get through quality control in the first place. With 30 emails sent back and forth from customer service, I was manipulated into thinking this error was somehow my fault and they could not offer me a replacement because the "dress/ ordered size was no longer in stock." Because of that, I could only either send the dress back for a refund or fix the problem myself with an outside seamstress. They only offered to refund up to $30 USD. Not only was it completely inappropriate to ask the customer to fix their problem, but only to reimburse me $30 is absolutely awful. Because I was running out of time for when I needed a dress, I had to cut my losses and keep the dress and get it fixed, which cost me $110 USD. I have tried contacting them from every type of media, but every service rep gives me the same repeated spiel. Do not waste your time and money ordering from here.	2025-04-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67f8353119ff693006011869	-0.078125	neutral	["dress", "get", "back", "customer", "service", "could", "refund", "fix", "problem", "usd"]

7129	houseofcb	Leah Marone	Overall good quality and beautiful dresses and reasonable service. On the flip side, returns are for personal charge (which is indicated at the website but annoying nonetheless). This wouldn't be a huge issue but sizing is really all over the place. The sizing on their website doesn't match - I am well within their XS measurements as indicated on the site, but don't fit some of the designs in that size (mainly due to the sleeves being exceptionally tight, and sometimes extremely tiny not even a child could fit..). Then sizing up to S works most of the time, but sometimes the S is huge, and sometimes even the S is too small. So very hit and miss on the sizing with a lot of variability between designs and items.	2025-04-07	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67f3d42650baa17b160065a1	0.1703781512605042	neutral	["sizing", "sometimes", "indicated", "website", "huge", "fit", "designs", "even", "overall", "good"]
7130	houseofcb	Gerogie 👸🏼	Quality isn’t as good as it used to be. Spend over 200£ on a dress and the zippers quality is like it’s literally not giving. Other than that the dress is nice out doesn’t get the full 5 stars because honestly when paying over £ 200 for a dress I expect e small details to be of quality. Think they have defo gotten worse in recent years and it’s a shame because they have such nice clothes. Still worth buying but be careful with certain dress styles. I do think also their dresses are overpriced. Should be half the price that they are tbh.	2025-03-26	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67ed0b64010e82a702e7321f	0.1659013605442177	neutral	["dress", "quality", "nice", "think", "good", "used", "spend", "200\\u00a3", "zippers", "like"]

Over three months and 30+ emails, they repeatedly sent me the wrong links, made errors, delayed responses for weeks, and ignored my follow-ups. After confirming my exchange was processed, they suddenly claimed I owed a price difference—which only existed because they gave me the wrong link in the first place! Their management took a month to reply, and they only respond when chased multiple times. No accountability, no compensation, just excuses and incompetence.

Customer service was extremely responsive and friendly the whole time, the exchanges were fast and easy, and I was able to exchange my dress twice and it still came in time to wear it to a wedding next week, I am so excited to wear the dress I got, it is gorgeous and great quality!

Had to return some dresses and it was a pain to deal with the return as they do not provide a return label, so you have to pay for yourself. Then, the return almost got returned back to us as they did not respond to courier's e-mail for additional information. They ship from Phillipines but have you return an item back to UK. And lastly, they provide you a "gift certificate" for a sale item, not offering a refund, as they only offer "store credit" for sale items which is plain illegal to do. And if that's not enough, we never even received the gift certificate. After trying to get in contact with them, they finally sent it after two months (and no it was never in "junk" e-mail as they suggested) only for it to not work at all when trying to make a new purchase - "gift certificate not valid". I am shocked how such a company with such practices can even exist in this day an age. This is plain money theft.

7142	houseofcb	Sophie Olson	I am so, so sad! I have always wanted a House of CB dress and I finally saved up enough to treat myself for one to wear at my law school graduation. I was so excited to get it. I try it on and it looks NOTHING like the photos! It's obnoxiously poofy and the cut is completely wrong. I showed it to multiple people and they couldn't believe it was such an expensive dress ($300!). Two separate people told me it looked like "temu quality". After some inspection, there were several loose threads all over the dress, including some of the threads that held the straps to the dress itself. The zipper is plastic and had a hard time moving up and down, the tulle was stiff and folded in on itself, and the lace was defective. It truly looked nothing like the pictures and videos on their website. I wish I could upload pictures so people could see. I usually don't leave bad reviews on things either. I'm going to have to return the dress & get a refund (which they require the customer to pay for!) and I'm so sad. I had looked forward to this brand for the longest time and to find out it's basically sweatshop quality was heartbreaking. They market themselves to be a high quality brand but you genuinely could get a better quality dress at a store like Windsor. The shipping time was okay, despite that they make you be present to sign for the box.	2025-03-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67db7896574f44d1ac5e6f2e	-0.09927052444909586	neutral	["dress", "like", "quality", "get", "people", "looked", "time", "could", "sad", "nothing"]

Their customer service team offer to comp my return up to 25 USD IF their team determined that it was a manufacturing error. I ordered this dress to take engagement photos and originally had plenty of time to source a new one, but because I chose to give them the benefit of the doubt I'm stuck with a 265 dollar dress that I paid an exta $30 for where the wire will undoubtedly poke out through with continued wear.

I contacted HoCB for an exchange but it was just outside their 28 day return/exchange window and they refused to exchange the size. Don't bother buying from this company. Their website is misleading. Some models are wearing the wrong sizes from what is stated on the website BUT most importantly, their sizing is all wrong and smaller than they should be.

7157	houseofcb	Jade Murray	I've been admiring House of CB dresses online for a long time and was thrilled to finally visit the Oxford Circus store. While the designs are appealing, I was disappointed by the quality, especially considering the price point. Some items looked promising, but the fabric quality and overall finish didn't justify the cost. I did purchase a dress for £50 in the sample sale upstairs. The dress fit well in the fitting room, but the sizing is quite inaccurate as I needed a size large even though I'm a size 10. The original price was £126, which I believe is excessive for a polyester dress of average quality. At the sale price of £50, it's somewhat justifiable, but I wouldn't pay full price for anything in the store. My recommendation would be to only buy from House of CB during sales, or at most, visit a physical store to try things on. The quality is inconsistent, making a try-before-you-buy approach essential to ensure the item meets your expectations for the price.	2025-02-14	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67b1ec4405a776d53858fe47	0.12838345864661652	neutral	["price", "quality", "store", "dress", "house", "visit", "\\u00a350", "sale", "size", "ive"]

7161	houseofcb	Susana	I ordered a dress from this company for almost 200 pounds. For that price, you would expect near perfection on a dress, unfortunately this was not the case. The boning was falling out and the lining was badly sowed, clearly showing signs of being a rush job. Unfortunately i had to keep it and take it to a tailor’s for a rush job as I needed the dress urgently. After trying to contact House of CB for some type of compensation, eg partial refund, my emails have been ignored and there has been NO response whatsoever on their end.

I have exchanged 14+ e-mails with them before they agreed to me sending the dress back that had faults.  They make it near on impossible for you to return items, with no guarantee of a refund. Looking at other peoples feedback about this Company I have no faith that my problem will be sorted to my satisfaction, and what good is a credit note with a Company that you have lost all faith with.  I could go on about my experience but my only suggestion is that you avoid this Company as they really do not deserve anyones business, read the one star reviews, I concur with every one of them.	2025-01-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679cc203dcfd39f7ade0672b	-0.13645833333333335	negative	["company", "faith", "one", "would", "preferred", "give", "stars", "customer", "service", "worst"]

7167	houseofcb	Nick R	Absolutely never purchase anything from this company. They don't care about their customers or if you are happy with your purchase or not. They only care about making a quick buck and then anything else is your problem after that. I purchased dresses from them as a Christmas gift and followed their sizing chart and even took new measurements to confirm. The dresses arrived too small even when following their sizing chart. I reached out to request an exchange for a different size and they told me they don't care and won't fix anything because part of the purchase also included accepting that no returns or exchanges are allowed. An online retail store selling clothing won't provide a different size when their own sizing chart produced a dress that didn't fit. This is the most basic practice when running an online clothing store and these people don't care at all. I will never purchase anything from them again and I strongly recommend you avoid scammers like this who don't care about their customers. I guarantee it will be a complete waste of your money to buy anything from this company.	2025-01-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679a5b6a719d6586b9ca4755	0.17206439393939396	neutral	["anything", "care", "purchase", "dont", "sizing", "chart", "never", "company", "customers", "dresses"]

7169	houseofcb	Coco Hannemann	I had an absolutely dreadful experience with House of CB and strongly advise against buying from them, especially during sales like Black Friday, when almost their entire website is discounted.I purchased several dresses during their Black Friday sale, intending to keep the ones that worked best for me. I returned the others in perfect condition, well within the 14-day return period. Their website advertises “easy returns”, encourages customers to “be picky”, and even promises two free exchanges, so I thought the process would be straightforward. Instead, they refused to refund me to my original payment method, issuing only store credit, despite me not being clearly informed of this restriction when I made my purchase.They claim there was a pop-up during checkout outlining their policy, but I never saw this pop-up, and when I asked for proof that I actively acknowledged this restriction, they couldn’t provide it. Instead, they kept referencing vague policies buried on their website. This lack of transparency feels incredibly unfair, especially since UK consumer law requires clear and prominent communication of such terms.To make matters worse, they referred to their refusal to refund me as “goodwill” while holding onto my money in the form of store credit. For a brand that markets itself as luxurious, their customer service and handling of this issue were shockingly poor.If you’re considering buying from them during a sale like Black Friday, be warned—if you need to return anything, you’ll likely be stuck with store credit you didn’t agree to. I wanted to love this brand and their dresses, but this experience has completely ruined my trust in them.Save yourself the stress and shop somewhere else.	2024-12-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6793f4ab4e56aabe07b1c7f7	0.04583333333333336	neutral	["black", "friday", "website", "store", "credit", "experience", "buying", "especially", "like", "dresses"]
7170	houseofcb	Victoria Engel	I am sad to say I am rating House of CB with 1 star after my first and last experience ordering a dress from them. The sad part is, I liked the dress. Here is my experience:I ordered a dress ($300+) received it within a few days.The dress was nice but did not fit so I started the process to exchange it, which seemed simple enough to do. After waiting some days I reached out regarding the larger size I exchanged for, and UPS would not deliver it due to you MUST be home to sign for the package. I was never told I had to sign for the package other wise I would have sent it to my work address as there's not way I would be able to receive the package working my full time hours. To top it off, I reach out to their dispatch email for support and they tell me I can pick up my package at UPS. Great I thought, except the UPS drivers never wrote on the note paper any address to pick up the dress at, and House of CB expressed they have no idea where it would be, and to reach out to UPS. After never being able to locate my dress for pick up, and feeling very frustrated at how difficult this is just to pick up a fkn dress, I reluctantly ask for a refund to be issued since the event I needed the dress for passed already. At this point I'm just tired of dealing with this and want to move on from this bad experience. Not only do they NOT issue me a refund, they tell me they won't until they locate the dress. WHICH IS ENTIRELY THEIT FAULT! It's in no way me, the customers fault, that they use UPS shipping service, who couldn't redeliver my dress in the first place, can't find the package. This company makes at LEAST over a million dollars a year, and they can't even fork over my refund FOR A DRESS I NEVER RECEIVED. The dispatch email has been dragging me along telling me the same story over and over that they can't refund me while they wait for UPS to locate the package. That's not my problem as the customer.Overall, I will never order or support House of CB ever again, and will continue to email, call, post reviews and comments until they issue me my refund. I wish I had read these reviews before spending (and now losing) $300.	2024-12-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67929ada72540cd0faf1a243	0.02107142857142859	neutral	["dress", "ups", "package", "never", "refund", "would", "pick", "house", "email", "locate"]
7171	houseofcb	Leo Leo	I wish I could give 0 stars. This company is the worst! I ordered the Persephone dress for a New Year’s Eve party. When I received the dress, I tried it on and it did not fit. WAYYY to tight. To start off sizing is completely off. I had the dress on for less than 1 minute and put it back in the box as soon as I took the dress off. I returned the dress and even paid for express shipping for it to get there in time so that they couldn’t tell me they received the item late. Mind you this dress was $330. They emailed me back saying the dress was completely soiled and showed signs of wear. I asked them to send me pictures because that was impossible. They still haven’t sent me pictures and told me they would be sending me back the dress. I don’t want the dress back. I want my refund back for a dress that did not fit and was not worn! then they email me back saying the ribbon was cut! SO FRUSTRATING! These people are LIARS and will take your money! DISGRACE to say the least. Avoid this company at all costs. If a dress doesn’t fit you they will not refund you and will make it seem like the dress was damaged or dirty. Make sure to take pictures of items u are returning before boxing it up. If that even helps. This company won’t be around for long if this is how they operate. Make sure to leave ur negative reviews on their Instagram page and any social media !!	2024-12-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/679163d8831f97d56eae912b	-0.11393831168831166	negative	["dress", "back", "company", "fit", "pictures", "make", "received", "completely", "even", "saying"]
7172	houseofcb	Lea	I ordered two dresses there and I never been so disappointed when opening a package. Both dresses are absolute horrible quality and feel like plastic, even though one dress was even named “cotton dress” and the long-sleeved one was even worse and felt like a stiff plastic table cloth. The stitching is anything but neat, there are already loose threads everywhere and the fit looks nothing like advertised. Because they were sale articles I will not even get a refund, only store credit, which is ridiculous given the horrendous quality in comparison to their really expensive prices - I won’t ever order there again. Do yourselves a favor and save your money - you can get this quality for a tenth of the price on wish or Shein…	2025-01-20	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67911b9ae6288317924522c8	-0.2674542124542125	negative	["even", "quality", "like", "dresses", "plastic", "one", "dress", "get", "ordered", "two"]

7175	houseofcb	Al	I absolutely love House of CB’s clothes and designs, but sadly, the customer service really lets the brand down. I purchased an item during the summer sale for £69, but unfortunately, it wasn’t suitable. What followed was a frustrating back-and-forth process that took far longer than it should have.  After involving a chargeback, they finally agreed to issue me a refund in the form of a store gift card. I returned the item (which they’ve since confirmed they received), but I’m still waiting for the gift card. As it stands, I’m out £69 with no garment and no store credit to show for it.  I hate having to leave a negative review, but this level of service is unacceptable. Processing a simple store credit voucher should not take this long. I love the brand and want to shop here again, but this experience has been incredibly disappointing.

7176	houseofcb	Melody Berkery	I have shopped at House of Cb a few times and never had issues, but I bought their 3 for £160 in the sale and only two items showed up and both were broken and then when I questioned where the third item was, they said it was being sent separately. I was never notified this would be happening...I was never sent a QR code so I could pick it up from the click and collect and the shop wouldn't let me pick it up without the QR code in time and it has now been sent back. They said I can send the two faulty items back for inspection. I've asked several times for a return address to send the faulty items back but no response on this!  This is the most frustrating customer service experience I've had. It's crazy to read that others are having the same issue with the sale items. It seems they used the sale items with no refunds to flog faulty items. It's also wild to me that expensive pieces would be made so cheaply and sent off without a quality check.	2025-01-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6789294a93d3ab0a80ae0027	-0.07333333333333333	neutral	["items", "sent", "never", "sale", "back", "faulty", "times", "two", "said", "would"]

For the price I paid (full price new season item), I would expect 1) better quality and 2) better customer service. But they have treated as if they are a fast fashion house. Tbh, even fast fashion houses have better customer service and recovery.

7178	houseofcb	Ebony	I returned a dress on the 3rd of December 2024. I contacted house of CB after wearing my graduation dress , and the wiring poking through my chest when sitting down at my graduation ceremony. I felt very uncomfortable getting up to receive my certificate because of this and had to cover the front of my dress with my hair. I previously had bought a smaller size and it was a bit too tight, so I went into a store to return and bought a different size, with recommendations by the staff working in the store that that size was suitable for me. I informed house of CB about this fault, and was asked to send photographs. I sent photographs in which no ribbon was obviously present. House of CB then asked me to return the dress for inspection , and in the email stated once received the return will receive confirmation email and it will take 2-5 days for return to be uploaded. It is over SIX WEEKS since I returned the item, and have not heard A THING. I have emailed multiple times to just be dismissed. ‘ we are chasing our team but getting no response’. SORRY when customers are involved how are you chasing your team but getting no response. I have been absolutely ASHAMED of the customer service I have received and NEVER EVER will i recommend this company to anybody. Selfish company, quick to snatch your money but when it involves a fault are no where to be seen. I will be warning anybody that ever want to purchase something from here. I am going to go above and beyond with this. Yes the policy stated no returns if worn however the company were AWARE it had been worn and broke on a very special occasion. I have worked three long and hard years to train to be a nurse and was excited to have a graduation. I’m in a job that is about giving to people, and this is more than what can be said about the people working for this company. Lack of care, lack of empathy, lack of communication. Shocking. Despite returns policy saying that they ASKED for pictures SAW there was no ribbon READ that I’d said it had happened whilst at graduation and asked for it to be returned. Shocking shocking customer service. Never again will I purchase from here. Upon reading reviews I was astounded to see the amount of people in a similar situation to me, and it has left me with 0 faith in this company. Quite obvious to me now the ridiculous response I will get maybe after 8 weeks based off what I have read. Money grabbers.FURTHER UPDATE - RECEIVED EMAIL ON SATURDAY AFTER 6 WEEKS SAYING ITEM IN LAST STAGE OF INSPECTION AND AWAITING MANAGEMENT TO AUTHORISE OUTCOME.TODAY RECEIVED EMAIL SAYING ‘IT WAS TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT WAREHOUSE TO BE INSPECTED AND HAS NOT REACHED RETURNS TEAM YET SO CANNOT CONFIRM OUTCOME ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVED INSPECTION CLOSE TO CONCLUSION SORRY FOR MIX UP’ BEYOND A JOKE SHAMBLES OF A COMPANY YOUD THINK WITH THE MONEY YOU PAY THEYD BE QUICK TO ASSIST 7 WEEKS AND STILL NOT EVEN REACHED THE BLOODY INSPECTION TEAM OR BEEN INSPECTED.STAFF ARENT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, EMAILS ARE UNHELPFUL, WHAT OTHER COMPANY TAKES THIS LONG?!

7179	houseofcb	Hande Uyanik	I am absolutely disgusted by my recent experience with House of CB, and this is coming from someone who works as a Customer Service Manager, so I know exactly what good service should look like. For a company that prides itself on class and quality, their customer service is a complete disgrace.I ordered the Belle dress in size XS, which should’ve fit me perfectly according to their size chart. I’ve purchased several House of CB dresses before, all of which fit fine, but this one didn’t even zip up. I reached out with my measurements and photos as proof, and they advised me to send the dress back with special delivery for inspection, assuring me they would refund the postage if it was a manufacturing error. Well, not only did I never hear back, but I was simply sent a bigger size (size Small) weeks later without any communication or resolution.When I contacted them again, they said there was no manufacturing error, so no refund for my postage. I explained that this can’t be true, as there’s lots of people saying the same thing about this dress. And plus, the new size still didn’t fit as it was now big, but they continued to dismiss my concerns with a generic response, even admitting that their sizing chart doesn’t align with the actual fit, and I quote “Our size chart serves as a reliable guide, and we take great care to provide measurements that are true to size. However, it is important to note that each of our items is uniquely designed and cut, and this can lead to variations in the way they fit” so they basically confirmed that they were selling an item that didn’t match with what they ADVERTISE!It’s beyond frustrating. They’ve refused to refund my postage costs, despite the fact that I received a product that was not as described. They said I could return this dress too, but that’s just more postage costs! It’s a huge letdown, especially as I used to be a loyal customer. This is my first Trustpilot review, but it’s about principle, and the fact that House of CB’s customer service is the worst I’ve experienced from any brand is saying a lot! If you’re thinking about ordering from them, be prepared for terrible service and no accountability.	2025-01-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67878f1f3b3e35773b4683f6	0.16081723154893887	neutral	["size", "service", "fit", "customer", "dress", "postage", "house", "chart", "refund", "even"]
7180	houseofcb	Kelsey Clancy	I’ve been a fan of House of CB in the past, but my recent experience has left me extremely disappointed. After their post-Christmas sale, I purchased a few items, including the Ariela dress. At checkout, the policy stated returns would be accepted for store credit. However, when I tried to return the items, I was told returns weren’t allowed at all. This inconsistency is incredibly frustrating and misleading.To make matters worse, the customer service has been some of the worst I’ve ever experienced—unhelpful, dismissive, and unresponsive. It’s shocking, especially for a brand that markets itself as high-end.The Ariela dress itself was another letdown. The fabric is shockingly cheap—thin, flimsy, and completely see-through. It feels nothing like the quality I previously experienced with House of CB, which makes this all the more disappointing.I used to associate this brand with quality and great design, but after this experience, I’m hesitant to shop with them again. If you’re considering a purchase, be cautious about their return policy and don’t expect consistent product quality.	2025-01-12	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67845f377881dbd8a3361ee2	-0.15937500000000004	negative	["quality", "house", "experience", "items", "ariela", "dress", "policy", "returns", "return", "brand"]

Interacting with their customer service team feels like talking to literal bots devoid of any empathy, reason, or basic competence. You must lack a soul to work here - they are rude, unhelpful, and will go out of their way to frustrate you at every step. What’s even more appalling is their blatant indulgence in illegal practices. Their sale return policies are downright illegal, blatantly violating the Consumer Rights Act 2015. I provided clear photo and video evidence of a manufacturing defect (faulty straps that were literally sewn on in the wrong direction) they refuse to acknowledge responsibility and instead hide behind nonsensical "policies" that have no legal standing. That is NOT how consumer rights work. They clearly know this, but they just don’t care.Offering store credit instead of a refund or replacement for defective goods is not just poor service, it’s illegal. I’m honestly disgusted by how shamelessly they try to get away with this.Avoid this company at all costs.

7197	houseofcb	Julie Bladow	I bought 4 dresses for this holiday season. At the house of cb section in Nordstroms. This brand never disappoints. The way it hugs my body and makes me feel so confidant. They accept returns on their website which is so easy as well. I order from their online store a lot. If you need a dress I highly recommend this brand.	2024-12-16	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6767017ef7d62e3dd7e7f007	0.2966666666666667	neutral	["brand", "bought", "dresses", "holiday", "season", "house", "section", "nordstroms", "never", "disappoints"]
7185	houseofcb	Miranda Culich	Stunning and Flattering Samaria Dress! I am absolutely in love with the Samaria dress from House of CB! The dark blue color is gorgeous and perfect for any occasion—whether it’s a formal event or a night out. I ordered a size small, and it fits like a glove. As someone with an A-C cup, the dress provides the perfect amount of support without feeling too tight or loose. The fabric is high-quality, and the detailing is impeccable. The way it hugs my curves in all the right places makes me feel confident and elegant. I can’t wait to wear this dress again!	2025-01-02	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/677aeed5dc761519a11d2c4d	0.38965855572998426	positive	["dress", "samaria", "perfect", "stunning", "flattering", "absolutely", "love", "house", "dark", "blue"]

7191	houseofcb	Nurai	I’m writing this review in the hope that other buyers in the UK, don’t suffer the same nonsense that I’ve endured over the last month… BEWARE!!! I’ve bought 20 dresses from House of CB this year, but unfortunately some of them came up smaller than usual. This in itself is ok, it happens with clothes.Unfortunately though, House of CB refused to allow me to swap these dresses for a larger size. This is despite the next size up being in stock, my keeping all the security tags on, not wearing the dresses & having contacted House of CB the same day that the dresses were delivered. Maybe it’s because the sale had ended and the dresses had now returned to their original prices? 🤷🏻‍♀️Anyway, many emails & 2 visits to their Oxford street and Westfield stores followed. Much time wasted.House of CB’s stance was that they refuse to exchange sale items when they say so. Well this is incorrect & it’s illegal for House of CB to do so. Consumer law in the UK protects Online customers, giving them rights to exchanges or even to get a full refund (within 14 days). EVEN, if it’s a sale item. This extra protection might be because the products have been bought unseen?It's also illegal in the UK to display any notice that deliberately misleads consumers or deceives them about their rights, for example a sign that says you do not accept returns or offer refunds.	2024-12-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67742784a15b0fd57fc4a625	0.0029411764705882314	neutral	["dresses", "house", "sale", "bought", "size", "illegal", "rights", "even", "writing", "review"]
7192	houseofcb	Katie	I purchased a corset at the end of November for a Christmas party. I tried it on the first time and it was perfect, took the tags off as I intended to keep it. I tried on the corset again when the my trousers arrived to try on the full outfit. The strap had nearly come off and the plastic structuring had pierced the fabric!!! The corset is £120!!!! I would expect much better quality for £120 but it’s absolutely awful. They then trick you with their returns policy that once the tag is cut it’s non-refundable or store credit, however an item should not fall apart this quickly. I am now at a loss of £120 and store credit i will never use. DO NOT BUY.	2024-12-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67729d1301c7878c13effa56	0.2728814987909226	neutral	["corset", "\\u00a3120", "tried", "store", "credit", "purchased", "end", "november", "christmas", "party"]

7194	houseofcb	Cheryl Renfrew	I ordered on 29-11. Almost a month later and I still haven’t received my “3-day delivery” package from House of CB. Too late for a party and too late for Christmas. They offered me 20% reduction but at this point it’s just useless to keep anyway. The fact that they offer a 3 day delivery is just false advertising.

7195	houseofcb	Tam	Normally I don’t do reviews, but this experience was so horrible. My recent experience with House of CB has been extremely disappointing. On December 3, I ordered a dress, carefully selecting my size based on the measurements of my body, the stretch factor, and the sizing chart provided on their website. To be absolutely sure, I also tried on a dress I already own from House of CB with the same stated stretch factor. Despite this, the dress I received was much stretchier than described.I immediately contacted customer service, who initially helped me decide between exchanging the dress for a smaller size (XS) or taking it to a tailor. Given how loose the dress was, I opted to exchange it for an XS.On December 6, I returned the dress with a tracking number and asked if they could offer Express Delivery for the XS, as I needed it by December 22 for a specific event. They informed me this wasn’t an option. I then asked if they could send the XS in advance, considering the urgency, but they refused, stating they needed to receive the returned dress first.Instead, they told me I could reorder the XS at full price, without the Black Friday discount I used for my original purchase. This meant paying €262 plus €55 in taxes instead of the €170 and €35 in taxes I initially paid—a total of €112 extra. Additionally, I had already paid for the return shipment. When I asked if they could honor the Black Friday price, they refused, claiming the discount had ended.This policy is not only inflexible but unfair, especially since the sizing issue was caused by incorrect product information on their website. A simple solution would have been to send the XS immediately and charge me later if there were any issues with the returned dress—which would not be the case, as I only tried it on and returned it immediately. Instead, I was forced to navigate a rigid and frustrating process.By December 14, tracking confirmed that they had received my return. However, I received no confirmation from their side, despite their website stating that returns are processed within 2-3 days. I asked them about the return and they say I needed to have patience because it takes 2-6 working days, so they are not so loyal to their policy. Today we are on the 7th working day and still no update. Still NO REFUND OR GIFTCARD. I’m tired of it, I emailed with them since December 3 and there still is no progress.Their unwillingness to provide solutions for a time-sensitive purchase, combined with the misleading product description and refusal to honor the original price, has left me deeply frustrated.House of CB misleads customers with discounts and fails to address issues caused by their own product descriptions. Despite the sizing issue being their fault, they refused to offer a full refund and only provided a gift card because it was a Black Friday sale. This does not resolve the issue, especially for a time-sensitive purchase. I used to recommend their brand, but after this experience, I can no longer do so until they improve their policies and customer service.Shame on you being a big company that you are and actually robbing people from their money. And giving all this poor service???? Some of us actually work hard to buy a dress on your website. If you are ordering with house of cb make sure that you know your sizes and make pictures of everything as evidence if you’re returning your dress. Because they are doing more people dirty.ORDER: 8331035	2024-12-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6769d1ad282e25c4377b0a26	-0.004901175213675228	neutral	["dress", "december", "website", "returned", "asked", "could", "experience", "house", "sizing", "despite"]
7198	houseofcb	Katie	When trying to return a dress (after I had ordered quite a few and spent a LOT of money with them) they told me they wouldn’t accept the return as ‘someone had tampered with the security ribbon’ that the dress comes with. I can assure you I NEVER touched or removed the pink ribbon and sent it back perfectly intact but they claimed I had ‘cut through it and tried to staple it back together’. It was very clear to me when they sent the dress back to me and didn’t accept the return, that they had tampered with this themselves - therefore fabricating a scenario so they don’t have to accept a return. For a premium brand such as this you would expect so much better. After I emailed and had basic correspondence disputing this they simply ignored my last email.

7200	houseofcb	Catherine Flynn	I purchased the Milena dress for a work event. Wore it for four hours and had to leave because the back seam had disintegrated (nothing to do with me squeezing in to the wrong size I assure you). I contacted customer services with pictures and received an apology and was asked to return the dress back for inspection. I waited 2 weeks and chased multiple times to be then sent an email to say it had failed the inspection because it did not have the new tag/ribbon attached - 2 weeks for them to tell me what id explained to them in my first (of 4) emails. They said it had to be “professionally repaired”. I do not accept this - why should a dress that cost £179 need to be professionally repaired after one 4 hour wear?! The quality of the dress is shocking and they accept this by saying they need to repair it. Why should I have to accept this?! I expect an exchange of the same dress at the very least! But if it had a policy of putting customers first I would actually expect a credit note or refund to not have to potentially put myself through the same experience. Awful quality. Awful service.	2024-12-20	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/676533ffec92f2b4ab4614d9	-0.2014520202020202	negative	["dress", "accept", "back", "inspection", "weeks", "first", "professionally", "repaired", "need", "quality"]
7201	houseofcb	Carla Duarte	Dear House of CB,I recently purchased three dresses from your sale offer of 3 dresses for £160. I was very excited about my purchase; however, upon receiving the items, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of two of the dresses, namely Elia and Tatiana.The descriptions on your website stated that both dresses were made of stretch cotton, but the items I received are completely different. The material is heavy, lacks stretch, and feels suffocating on the skin. It resembles nylon or plastic—much like the fabric used for umbrellas—making the dresses unwearable, especially during the European summer. They are not flattering at all and are far from what was described on your website.To add to my frustration, I have tried the Tatiana dress in-store (in brown), and the fabric was entirely different from the one I received in my online order. This inconsistency has left me questioning the quality control and authenticity of the items sold online versus in-store.I am extremely disappointed with this experience and feel let down by the misleading descriptions and poor quality of these dresses.	2024-12-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/676398c3e18f785711bccdf8	-0.1548611111111111	negative	["dresses", "items", "quality", "extremely", "disappointed", "descriptions", "stretch", "received", "different", "fabric"]

One of my favorite pieces and honestly, well worth the price. Anyone saying the quality is cheap— Ive been designing and making my own clothes since middle school— there are proper ways to put on certain dresses and I feel as if once you hook the top loops, the dress zips without a problem— if the top hook isnt hooked the dress wont zip past the skirt because you have it too stretched! Simple fix! The dress is stunning, the material, everything about it is a dream. Not only does it FIT me comfortably for my size, but I almost didn’t even want to take it off because of HOW it fit…so snug and comfortable yet I could BREATHE! 100/10 I cannot thank House of CB enough.	2024-12-13	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/675f2711b56305eb9a73b76b	0.25758928571428574	neutral	["dress", "hook", "top", "first", "issues", "order", "process", "shipping", "extremely", "fast"]

It was like Instagram had come to life, all the dresses set out in such a beautiful way, the dresses set up like Barbies wardrobe, I wanted them all ! The security guard even helped me find my way after I got separated from my friends and was quite lost without a map. He brought up a map and helped me to my next shop which was so lovely as I’d have been lost without his directions ! My dress got wrapped in pink tissue paper and a beautiful pink floral paper bag at the till free of charge much to my surprise and my receipt even got put in an envelope!  The dress was the pink Mademoiselle dress and it’s really good quality, the silk is so thick and the petticoat underneath is perfect for the dress. Wouldn’t hesitate to visit the shop again.

7216	houseofcb	Ella	The customer service is awful. They sell faulty and poor quality garments at exorbitant prices and make it impossible for you to return anything and are rude to boot! I ordered a top and trouser set which did not fit, I returned the outfit and have only been refunded for the top. When flagging this with customer service I had to send several emails over several days before getting a response and now they are refusing to refund the item, suggesting that I’m lying and never sent it back and have been condescending and patronising in their communication. This is the third time I’ve had an issue with an order that they have not resolved. Save your time, effort and money and shop elsewhere!	2024-12-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6754cdfb6103040f50234901	-0.13680555555555554	negative	["customer", "service", "top", "several", "time", "awful", "sell", "faulty", "poor", "quality"]

7218	houseofcb	JB	Firstly the company sent the wrong size that was ordered, then upon offering to send the correct size the very next day it went out of stock. Service is horrendous. Additionally, if you need to make a return they ask you to pay for the returns and they will then reimburse you.In store is just as bad. Went to the Oxford Street location and noone is helpful and even though they had a size in stock, was told to buy it and try it at home then return it if it's not the correct size. Really poor service again.	2024-12-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6751b24597a5f439af02833b	-0.26999999999999996	negative	["size", "correct", "went", "stock", "service", "return", "firstly", "company", "sent", "wrong"]

7221	houseofcb	Holly	I love everything about this brand. They are such high quality pieces, well made pieces that make you snatched. They are tailored so  beautifully, normally like double lined, boned and stitched beautifully. You can get special adjustments for height and bust size. And the pieces are so romantic and feminine. I had a great experience in the past when enquiring about stock. I then contacted them today and was helped by Victoria and Lara and they were both sooo helpful, they went above and beyond to help me as it was really my mistake and I was able to put through my desired order that day! They responded each time within like an hour or two and were just so lovely and helpful! In the middle of a massive sale too! I’m so excited to get my things, even the way they package things makes me so happy. Feels like shopping at like a very high fashion boutique for such a reasonable price. I tell everyone about it and to shop there.

7222	houseofcb	Emily Lewis	I bought a dress in August for holiday. Unfortunately when the dress arrived it was too small on my bust so I had to return it. I followed the returns process and received an email on 27/09/2024 to say my order had been refunded and the funds would be in my account within 5-10 working days. I checked my account regularly for the funds being returned. After 10 days I still hadn’t received the funds. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and allowed a few extra days. On 19/10/2024 I reached out to their customer support and asked what details they had paid the money to. I got a response which stated :“Thank you for reaching out to us with your concern.Last week our payment processor encountered an issue in their servers and there's been some refund transactions that were unsuccesfully processed but they've reached out to us yesterday to let us know that this issue has finally been fixed and the failed transactions are being processed once more. I've just checked for your transaction particularly and it hasn't been completed yet but rest assured that it will be very soon. We're very sorry for any inconvenience caused and greatly appreciate your patience regarding this matter. Please keep in mind that you can keep track of your refund reimbursement by checking your bank statements from the date you placed your order (August 20th) and onwards.”Firstly I found it vaguely patronising to tell me how I could keep track of the refund when clearly I had been checking which is how I identified it wasn’t there. Secondly it seemed poor not to let customers know there was an issue with refunds unless they specifically chased it. Fast forward to today, I had a particularly busy month and was just getting round to checking my statements. I was shocked to see I still have not been refunded. I paid £199 for a dress, which is not an insignificant amount of money. The dress was returned more than two months ago refund was promised to me nearly 8 weeks ago.I am very disappointed in the service from this brand and the disregard for consumer law (citizens advice state refunds should be paid within 14 days which has clearly been breached here.)Considering the brands presence on social media and following it says a lot that they are unable to get the essentials right.	2024-09-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/673d2d3d14be387d57d016c2	-0.06255760368663596	neutral	["dress", "days", "refund", "funds", "paid", "issue", "keep", "checking", "august", "received"]
7223	houseofcb	Chanelle Kerr	The dress itself is beautiful, great fabric and design, however, the sizing is terrible. I am a size 8-10 bottoms (AU/UK) and a 10-12 top (AU/UK). By their true to size standards i should be a medium. How3ver i tried on a Large and it was still too small. I have ended up with an XL that their site claims is for a size 16 (AU/UK). That is 3 sizes difference. So, I wouldn't order online as you won't be getting a true to size item. Definitely size up.	2024-11-18	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/673af2337f47fbb4fff19c56	0.20158730158730157	neutral	["size", "auuk", "true", "dress", "beautiful", "great", "fabric", "design", "however", "sizing"]

They make it really difficult to return items and like to pin the blame on the buyer! Once they have your money if you have any issues you will be stuck and be prepared to go to your payment method for a refund.

It really felt like a luxurious shopping experience as the staff even take your chosen items and hang them up in the changing rooms for you! They could not have been more helpful and went to get other sizes for me too. The shop was laid out beautifully and was a visual treat for the eyes. My purchase was carefully wrapped in tissue paper and placed in a lovely bag that made me feel indulged and special. This shop is a fantastic place to come if you want to feel you are treating yourself to a beautiful piece of clothing. There is a huge range of dresses to choose from if you are on the hunt for that head turning outfit. I left the store a very satisfied customer and will certainly be returning again in the near future!	2024-11-09	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67370826284988431fe8203f	0.38035714285714284	positive	["store", "customer", "shop", "feel", "visited", "saturday", "9th", "november", "extremely", "impressed"]
7227	houseofcb	Jeseca Lenon	I have given them chance after chance because I love the look and style but they never fit real bodies. - First time: I bought 3 final sale dresses and even though my measurements matched the size guide, I couldn’t even get them remotely close to zipped up. I had to really argue for a refund by showing them my waist measurements matching the size guide and pictures of how far off the dress was. - 2nd time: i bought a sleeved top and the smaller size didn’t fit my arm thickness (average body type) and the larger size completely fell off my shoulders. - 3rd time: one corset top fit and the very same size I couldn’t get on. I exchanged it for a larger size and now it has this weird gape in my boob. I have nice DD’s and it makes me look flat chested and saggy because there’s extra fabric where there shouldn’t be. Oh and the strap broke when I was trying it on! By now I have come to the conclusion that they make their clothes for instagram models with thin bodies and giant boobs and then they don’t actually flatter real bodies. For the price, I’d expect more effort had gone into perfecting the cut so it was flattering on different body types. Super disappointing as I do like their pieces but they only look good on their models and other models/celebrities.	2024-11-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/673470b5bbea979ca9118276	0.09666666666666668	neutral	["size", "look", "fit", "bodies", "time", "chance", "real", "bought", "even", "measurements"]
7228	houseofcb	mary	Update 14/11/23:  It has been a bit of long process but I have been offered a replacement dress for my daughter, which we were very happy about as she loved the dress. Thank you to house of CB for following through on my return.I have written a previous review about my experience with House of CB.  I requested an exchange  for a faulty product (see previous review updated on 30/10/24).  I returned the dress as they requested (at my expense) and they received it on the 24th October.  After two weeks I had heard nothing so chased them.  I was assured I would hear back soon, another week later and still no response.  I shop within a similar price range regularly and never have I received such terrible customer service.  Their dresses are beautiful designs for young people but the customer service puts me off ever buying my daughters a dress from them again.  It seems very short sighted not to want repeat customers.	2024-11-12	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6733bc0538ae0bcc385ffd41	0.08444444444444445	neutral	["dress", "house", "previous", "review", "requested", "received", "customer", "service", "update", "141123"]
7229	houseofcb	Cat	I am just going to keep it short cause this company should be called house of utter disgrace instead. Ordered a dress for €293. Wore it once to a wedding, straps started falling apart. They did their utmost to refuse a refund and instead opted to repair it. Fast forward now. Second time I wore it, I notice holes on the back of the dress. The incompetent robot customer service team is trying to blame me for washing it instead of dry cleaning when washing garments in COLD water and handwashing it should not in anyway cause holes. I washed silk stuff this way and it never disintegrated, plus, I honestly don’t know if the holes were there prior to washing since they were at the back. I wrote were because this dress is now in a dump yard somewhere. They continue to insist that its my fault, the straps breaking were not my fault and the holes at the back were not my fault either. The fault is your incompetence to acknowledge that your clothes are of Shein quality. Actually worse, because I have had shein clothes that lasted longer! They are refusing me my right to a refund and continue to ignore most of what I say and try to shut me down. I am not backing down and I will be getting my money back. They offered me a return the first time the straps broke and I was foolish to accept a repair instead not knowing that this dress is made out of paper.

7230	houseofcb	Stephi	WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! tried to place an error with them and my payment kept getting declined. Called my bank and they said there was nothing wrong with my card, they GUARANTEED it was a merchant issue. So I reached out to house of CB for the most frustrating experience ever! Not only do staff not give a crap about helping but they are super rude and dismissive. They initially denied it was their issue despite showing screenshots from my bank saying it was then just said well try a different card. I say I don’t have a different card and you can’t explain why you’re system is rejecting this.Her: “are you sure your address matches or you put the number in right?” 🙄🙄 as if I haven’t used this same card a million times in a million other places without issue. And yea I tried like 6 times lady, the number and address is right.Asked to speak to a manager or supervisor multiple times and they IGNORED me and refused, then just told me “have you tried a different browser” YES, okay then just wait a few days. 🙄 And I complain well how do I know in a few days it won’t be rejected again? No answer, no help. Like wow you think they would want to help someone trying to buy $900 for 2 dresses but apparently they don’t give the tiniest crap about their customers, don’t even try to help you . They clearly just brush you off and want you to go away, couldn’t care less about helping the customer, LISTENING to them or trying to resolve anything.Pretty sure they’re going to suggest next I’m spelling my name wrong because they just keep saying the dumbest possible things and not helping. Also probably why there is NO PHONE NUMBER to contact them. Much easier to overcharge people and provide abysmal customer service when you don’t have to talk to them and just send a pointless email every 3 days until the customer gives up.Horrible company. I can only imagine how hard it would be to return something based on their embarrassingly bad customer service. Shoutout to Ariana and Jamie who were particularly useless and REFUSE to connect me to a manger or supervisor because they prefer to waste my time with ridiculous suggestions. I suggest you both get a different job. Oh and they ALSO LIE TO CUSTOMERS and say they offer “free international shipping” on their homepage but of course that’s not true and even if you spend almost a grand, shipping isn’t free to Canada it’s $22USD so again this company is very dishonest as well.	2024-11-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6733b4663181fad4f0067306	-0.0809686147186147	neutral	["customer", "card", "different", "service", "tried", "issue", "helping", "well", "number", "times"]

I was put off ordering because of the bad reviews but I finally took the plunge and both orders have been without issue. I followed the sizing chart and both dresses have fit perfectly. The quality is outstanding and the dresses are just stunning. I’m completely obsessed with this company and I don’t think I’ll be buying my dresses from anywhere else. It’s worth noting that these dresses are definitely built for an hourglass figure so bear that in mind when ordering.

They will loose so many customers as I can see I am not the only one that didnt receive a refund. Luckily I paid with a credit card so I have contacted my bank to report this fraud company!!!!!	2024-10-20	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67158f2c13ab22424805dbf6	0.1023076923076923	neutral	["one", "didnt", "sent", "refund", "bough", "dressess", "fit", "backon", "27092024", "theyve"]
7247	houseofcb	Alex	I ordered a dress for an event, and when it arrived it was rammed into a box that was far too small for it which was a shame as it was very creased. The dress has a big skirt and a petticoat-type underneath so it's quite big and although I chose sustainable package it was clearly too small for the packaging. Unfortunately, when I tried the dress on, we couldn't get the zipper to work properly so I reached out to customer service to explain and let them know I was sending the dress back. I had paid for next day delivery so initially I had asked if it was possible to get this money back since I physically couldn't wear the dress.This is where I feel the customer service went really poorly. Clearly the team are trained to advise you to do anything and everything but return the dress. After somebody came back to me asking for pictures and videos of the issue, I let them know that regardless of the issue I now needed to return the dress because I couldn't wear it to the event so I would just be returning it (which is within their returns policy). I even said that it didn't matter if they couldn't refund my shipping, and emphasised that I just wanted to send the dress back.They then emailed me back saying I had to send pictures of the issue so they could advise me on the refund.I replied explaining I was now away (at said event) and wouldn't be able to do so and I just wanted to return the dress, but they sent me a further email basically demanding I send pictures. So, when I returned from my trip I had to ask my sister to come over specifically to take images/video of the issue and in my email back to them I explained that regardless of the issue I just wanted to send the dress back because I no longer needed it, and somebody came back to me with instructions on how to potentially make the zip work - they had completely ignored my request to return the dress. I was under the impression I had to let them know before I returned the dress, but this may have been incorrect. However, the aftersales department refused to actually listen to me and have repeatedly just insisted I try to make the zip work. I have not tried it again as I no longer need the dress, and I wouldn't force it because I didn't want to risk breaking the zip.It seems to me that the team are taught to ignore any requests for a refund and only follow a structure of getting you to do anything but send it back. I found them to be quite patronising and frustrating as I spoke to 3 different people in a single process and was just going in circles when all I wanted to do was return the dress.In short, the service from start to finish (the packaging to the zip to the customer service) has been extremely disappointing and stressful, and I saved up for a while to purchase this dress and have found that what should have been a treat has become a bit of a nightmare. For such an expensive product, I really didn't expect the process to be so difficult and I just feel super disappointed by the whole thing.You might have a better experience in the shops themselves but I personally don't think I'll be able to trust this company again and I certainly wouldn't recommend them to my friends.Added: I can see the customer service team have responded and I would like to clarify that upon finally sending pictures, the next response did not advise me on my return but simply instructed me on how to make the zip work - which made me particularly concerned and a bit stressed that they were trying to avoid me returning the dress. They didn't actually say 'yes you can return the dress' until I sent a final email repeating that I didn't need the dress anymore and wanted to return it. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't an absolutely monstrous experience (and if your dress is perfect when it arrives then you'll probably be fine) but I just wouldn't recommend them after this.	2024-10-15	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67155cf5479fb475c8a7aa53	0.009435626102292764	neutral	["dress", "back", "return", "service", "issue", "didnt", "wanted", "send", "couldnt", "work"]
7248	houseofcb	Saba Shakir	Absolutely remarkable dresses with top notch quality! I recently wore the Mademoiselle Dress (in black) to the International Astronautical Congress in Milano and it was a HEAD TURNER. EVERYONE at the conference was turning around just to marvel at the dress! I was later approached by someone who told me that I inspired them to "never again dress more masculine to be taken seriously in the sector." and that it gave them "the confidence to now dress more feminine regardless of what (male) space engineers think.” So a huge THANK YOU to House of CB for making dresses for women to empower other women!	2024-10-17	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6714c9e6ea6becbf8894b620	0.17067307692307693	neutral	["dress", "dresses", "women", "absolutely", "remarkable", "top", "notch", "quality", "recently", "wore"]

7250	houseofcb	Irena Paliokaite Irena_pa	Bought the dress online for my wedding weekend. From beginning The brands corresponding while waiting for the order was below the industry’s norm. It concluded of 12 of the same “Order tracking” email, that once you open it says access denied. No other purchase confirmation email to make the client feel trust.It arrived later than it mentioned on their website and I knew I will not be able to use it as intended, thought never mind, happens. I quickly tried it on, the fit was slightly loose, I have packed it as beautifully as I received and send it back, paying the additional 30€ which I thought is a bit ridiculous. And that’s where it all started. Also must mention, that order came from UK, but the return had to travel to Spain. The refund slip and return overall is not user friendly, but I figured it out.The dress was sent back on 14th of September and now is 18th of OCTOBER! There was no communication from the brand and I noticed, that there’s no refund coming my way. I have proof of every step this parcel made, and the proof, that the parcel was received by House of CB, I already checked this with the post office.Had to chase this with their customer service and it is of no use, it seems it exists only to show, that the business is legit. In my search of a refund, I have sent number of my order, tracking code of a parcel, the proof that it was sent and received by them and all the important dates. The person in customer service who finally reached out is named Lara, she send one email saying that she will double check with the warehouse. Now it has been 8 days and she is no longer responding, perhaps she travelled to Spain to check for parcel herself. Overall: I have no dress, they are withholding my money for more than 30 days, plus the audacity of additional 30€ charge for me to send item back and not hear from them. I am not planning to let this go I am sure what this business is doing is in breach of consumer rights.Their silence on social media and the responses I am now reading here is an abomination.	2024-10-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/67126f4ca956d881ada5bb0a	0.15408305462653288	neutral	["order", "parcel", "dress", "email", "received", "send", "back", "refund", "sent", "proof"]

7253	houseofcb	Tasha Grossi	Absolutely shocking experience. Spent £180 on a dress, which I wore once and it broke (literally ripped in half). I wrote 2 emails asking to be contacted and heard nothing. I ended up messaging on instagram to get my money back for an extortionately priced dress, and they said they would give me a refund. It’s now been 4 days, I have chased every single day asking for an update / the refund to get processed and they keep reading my message and not replying. House of CB has terrible customer service, and also terrible overpriced dresses. If you are thinking of purchasing  dress from here abroad I would save yourself the hassle in case something is not right as NO ONE will reply to you. Update - (to reply to the below) there is no order number as I have purchased this in the London store. Furthermore, I sent 2 contact requests via the website using separate emails so I find it hard to believe my requests were pushed to the back of the queue. Even if they were it would have been over 2 weeks and no reply which is pretty shocking. I am speaking to someone via instagram trying to sort out the store contacting me to issue a refund however I don’t seem to be getting anywhere as I am still yet to receive a phone call… :/	2024-10-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/671013907b7241e7ebcd18bb	-0.3671245421245421	negative	["dress", "would", "refund", "reply", "shocking", "emails", "asking", "instagram", "get", "back"]

7255	houseofcb	Akanksha	Super stressful experience with house of CB a nightmare never shopping at HOUSE OF CB Again in my life I couldn't response to House of CB response on my previous review so here I am writing it again ..The most hurtful part of this entire experience is that House of CB has shown no genuine empathy or apology for the inconvenience caused. Not once did they say "sorry" for the frustration and disappointment I’ve gone through. Instead, their response comes across as dismissive, almost as if they’re proud of the rigidness of their policies. It’s not just about the poor return policy—it’s the complete lack of customer care and understanding that makes this experience even worse. A simple acknowledgment of the inconvenience would have gone a long way, but sadly, that was completely absent. I must express my deep dissatisfaction with your handling of this situation and your return policy. I am extremely disappointed in both the inflexibility and lack of customer care demonstrated by your company. I feel compelled to clarify a few critical points and request that this issue be addressed. Unreasonable Return Policy: Your return policy, while stated on your website, is unreasonable and in this particular case, quite misleading. The dress I received was completely unwearable due to sizing issues that were immediately apparent when I tried it on. The zipper was physically impossible to close, and the fit was so tight it was physically painful. I cut the ribbon only to test the fit, and this was a reasonable action given the dress was otherwise unwearable. I had no intention to wear or keep the item, and I fully acknowledge that the dress has not been worn, damaged, or altered in any other way beyond this ribbon.Inflexibility in Return Process: Despite reaching out to your customer service for a return, your response has been utterly dismissive and unhelpful. I am being penalized for a minor action (cutting the ribbon) that did not affect the condition of the dress in any meaningful way. This is highly manipulative and seems designed to prevent customers from being able to return faulty or ill-fitting items. Your policy seems less about protecting your business and more about finding ways to avoid honoring a fair return.Store Purchase History: You mentioned that if I could provide proof of purchase from your store, you would consider the return. However, your refusal to check your store's purchase history, especially when I provided reasonable proof that I bought the item from your Westfield location, demonstrates a lack of goodwill. Your policy appears to be designed to block valid returns, making it difficult for customers to resolve issues in a fair and transparent way.This experience has been a complete nightmare. I would advise everyone to avoid shopping here. House of CB has no customer service skills very rude and disrespectful towards customer just so they can save few bucks like 170 Pounds never seen any other brands being so cheap REPLY/UPDATE - I am absolutely shocked and frustrated by the way I’ve been treated. It is completely false to claim that my dress was worn—it hasn’t been. I’m left speechless by the lies and the manipulation at play here. You are so cheap I don't have any words left for you neither to fight you anymore. Your cheap company can keep few bucks I wanted other people be aware before they get scammed by you. ALSO My question is simple: If I bought the same dress in-store, how does that make my online dress eligible for a refund? How does this even make sense? Are you seriously going to continue to claim that my dress is used when it is clearly not or you just want to make sure I got the same dress in store so you will refund for online dress and if I don't have proof then my dress is worn out and not eligible for refund how does this makes sense do you even know what you are saying in front of all the people who will be reading these reviews? just answer my simple question why do you need proof of purchase are you kidding me??? you are clearing stating how cheap and scam you are??? This feels like nothing more than an attempt to scam customers and save a few bucks at their expense. I’m appalled by the cheap, dishonest service provided by House of CB. This experience has been a nightmare, and I will never be returning to this place again.To anyone considering an online purchase, think twice before buying from this company. It’s been a truly disappointing experience, and I strongly advise against it.	2024-10-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/670e3e22aa53e16d212b34b2	-0.02116541353383458	neutral	["dress", "return", "experience", "house", "customer", "policy", "purchase", "cheap", "response", "way"]

7258	houseofcb	Peckham	I would have given zero stars if Trust Pilot permitted it.What an awful experience - beware of this company. It is meant to be a luxury brand. My 16 year old daughter saved up to buy a dress for her TY ball. We are in Ireland and she had to pay an additional £47 import duty but it was the dress she wanted so... It arrived quickly, lovely packaging, she was so excited to receive the dress she had saved for. What a disappointment. The stiching on the chest area was very poor, the straps were badly sewn and placed unevenly. Disappointed but knowing we could send it back and once the return had been received we could claim the import duty back from UPS, we packaged it back up. We live in Rural Ireland and therefore used the post office (A Post) to return. Paid Euro 22.50 for tracked insured post. Used the return label from the package which House of CB provided. Posted on 27 September 2024, the package still hasn't arrived (10 October 2024). For some reason House of CB, posted from UK but the return label was an address in Spain. I have emailed House of CB customer services (they don't have a phone number) so all correspondence has to be back and forth through email. House of CB have said I must speak to Correos, the Spanish postal service. Correos have said I must speak to AnPost, the Irish Postal service. AnPost have said I must speak to House of CB as they provided the address. Meanwhile my 16 year daughter is close to losing £280 and now has no dress or money to buy another one. Avoid this company. They may have been luxury once upon a time but not any more.	2024-10-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/670799c601ff3d02c7832844	-0.1152139037433155	negative	["house", "dress", "back", "return", "post", "said", "must", "speak", "company", "luxury"]
7259	houseofcb	Belinda Davis	Couldn’t have been more disappointed with this company.Ordered two dresses in hopes to find my 30th birthday dress after years of following them on Instagram in hopes of owning one.I ordered two really lovely dresses to have choice, I ordered a size small in both as it said size 8-10 and I’m probably somewhere in the middle of both of those sizes.I tried them on only to find I was never ever going to be able to close the zip the dress fit more like a 4-6.Really gutted I had to return and then the nightmare began,figuring out how to return the dresses is a task in its self and then the ridiculous boxes they send them in are a nightmare to get the dresses back into.then realising I was liable to pay return postage and paying for a new bag to bag them up into,  it cost me £31 to return two dresses.For a luxury dress brand being charged so much to return due to no free return and silly packing is shocking, I’m now down £31 for essentially trying on two dresses that were never going to fit again due to false sizing charts.Will not be ordering again unless the returns became free.	2024-10-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6706f85d92d87d5e56d91f33	-0.016101010101010105	neutral	["return", "dresses", "two", "dress", "hopes", "find", "ordered", "size", "never", "going"]

I am so happy with the service and love love love the dresses!	2024-09-12	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66eabcef11b9875daeac659f	0.4098484848484849	positive	["love", "great", "dresses", "service", "nothing", "experience", "company", "fit", "torn", "small"]
7273	houseofcb	Sandra	Avoid them. Their items are pretty yes, but would rather spend the money somewhere else. First order I received was fine, but too small as the size chart is not correct. Made my second order for the next size just expecting to return the first one. Second order I received was not only a broken item but also what seemed to someone else’s return (trash packaging and not at all as the first delivery). Have spent so much time back and forth with them. Just avoid at all costs. - size charts are incorrect - got a broken item delivered - their customer service is completely useless. They answer you, but provide no actual answers or support. Echoing all other 1 start reviews in here on the terrible customer service and over all experience. Update: Since I cant reply to the Comment below from CB, adding answer here.I do know how to read size charts… I actually sew, alter and create patterns my self. So no, your charts do not represent correct sizing. Even when considering the fabric type and quality (jersey, non-stretch, jacquard etc). And the email you have sent is a summary of the event. Great… absolutely no help or in other ways amendment for the insane amount of time spent on back and fourth with you. AVOID!!	2024-09-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66e9d17982f7373b346f9e90	-0.09551282051282052	neutral	["size", "avoid", "first", "order", "else", "received", "correct", "second", "return", "broken"]
7275	houseofcb	Zoe Urbanowicz	Had the most amazing experience in the Manchester store on Tuesday.As soon as I walked in, I was made to feel welcome and like I was the only one in the shop. Phoebe and Danielle were incredible.I was looking for their bridal collection which they told me they didn’t stock in store. However Phoebe asked me what dress I was looking at and like magic, she had one in the back in my size. I got a few more dresses to try on and they gave me some heels to try on with them.I got changed into the first dress and they zipped up the dress for me and made sure it was laid on me properly. They called my mum over and my mum immediately started crying which made me cry. Phoebe was nearly crying herself after I told her about my love story with my fiancé. They made me feel confident in the dress. They made me feel so secure about having my tattoos on show. I had never felt better.Afterwards, Phoebe steamed the dress for me and packaged the dress for me in the most beautiful paper and box. It was just meant to be. I’ll be emailing the store pictures of my wedding as they asked to see.I’ll how go to house of cb every time I need a dress ❤️	2024-09-10	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66e33cf7497dfc21bed210c4	0.3222222222222222	positive	["dress", "made", "phoebe", "store", "feel", "like", "one", "looking", "told", "asked"]
7276	houseofcb	Anna Bella	There is a REASON why they HAVE NO REVIEWS on their website!!! RED FLAG!!!!Bought 4 dresses (one regular priced and 3 for 80usd each). 2/4 of them did NOT fit. Both illfitted dresses could not get the zipper up (where the corset bottom and skirt aligned), as well as INCORRECT sizing. I am a 34bust, 28waist and 36hips (fits into a small on their website) and both the LOVA and Mademoiselle are MUCH smaller than advertised. The LOVA Small is closer to a XXS (to the point of being unable to snap the top button up on my bust), and the Mademoiselle small is more like a XS. I had to chase customer service to fix the problem as well sent videos of the problem. They told me to send them back (and I PAID FOR THE POSTAGE), and that if there was a manufacturing problem they would refund me my postage. A week later (after the parcel had arrived) I had to chase them again for an outcome. They said that there was no manufacturing problem and that they would not be sending me a replacement, instead would send a special one time store credit, for what I paid and did not listen to anything I had to say. Basically told me to suck rocks and that if I wanted the correct outcome of this, that I would have to pay MORE MONEY and MORE POSTAGE, to fix THEIR problem. STAY AWAY!!!Not helpful customer service and AWFUL company to deal with. The dresses are okay but WAY over priced for the headache of it all.	2024-09-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66e203c8dc662620af77ca9c	0.023949579831932778	neutral	["problem", "would", "dresses", "small", "postage", "website", "one", "priced", "well", "lova"]
7277	houseofcb	Kat	What I love about houseofcb it’s the quality of their dresses. I love the corset style and the unique romantic style of their clothes. Also the fact that they have more variety of sizes like large, +large and the photos of models on instagram are with different sizes. Also I would never believe that I could find my wedding dress so easily and so to my style. I know the products are bit pricey but for the quality its worth it. I wish every girl can have this opportunity to wear one their dresses.	2024-02-02	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66e1c3e7054dc736e2ad83f3	0.30369047619047623	positive	["style", "love", "quality", "dresses", "also", "sizes", "large", "houseofcb", "corset", "unique"]
7278	houseofcb	Demarie Won	I would like to accuse this hypocritical and deceitful brand, a brand that clearly does not take the interests of the consumer seriously. on the 6th of September I ordered 10 or so items from the brand for our team's grand celebration, and when placing the order I found out that I would need to pay a tax, but all I could think of was that it was a reasonable thing to do when purchasing clothes from abroad to pay for the import tax and so I paid it. However, after waiting for a few days, when the shipment was about to arrive at our customs, I was short of receiving a large number of emails from CB's forwarder, UPS, repeatedly informing me that I needed to complete customs clearance before I could receive the clothes. In response, I went back and forth several times, telephoning UPS customer service, who claimed that CB's shipments themselves took the form of seller-paid taxes and fees, and that I had to cooperate with Customs by uploading the relevant information in order to complete customs clearance. As there were not many days left before our team's grand celebration, I thought I had no more time to keep waiting for this shipment, so I asked CB to provide me with a full refund and pay the taxes and fees themselves. However, CB insisted that they are not responsible for this, nor for the delivery delays caused by them, refused to refund me, and were extremely arrogant and rude, with no regard for my feelings as a consumer, and I would strongly advise anyone not to shop with such a brand again!	2024-09-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66e1677d634280b786889e76	0.06087662337662336	neutral	["brand", "customs", "would", "pay", "consumer", "teams", "grand", "celebration", "order", "tax"]
7279	houseofcb	Fiona	So I bought a dress for my daughter to wear for my wedding where she was bridesmaid and that she had chosen online. I was visiting London so I simply picked it up and brought it to the till. The dress was not tried on in store and when I got to the till, the girl serving me showed something on the dress to another girl who then shrugged and told her to package it. When we returned home my daughter tried the dress on. One strap was misaligned and twisted as a result when it was attached, the other strap was falling off and there was makeup inside the bodice where someone had previously worn it. For 226 euros, I was horrified at the quality and the shoddiness. These were obviously things noticed by the salespeople and ignored. The dress itself was also entirely see through (the website says it’s sheer) and looked like it cost less that 20 euros to make. I wrote immediately to complain as I now had to source another dress for the wedding. The girls I dealt with were very helpful and it seemed to be going well. However, late last night I received an email to say “good news, my manager has approved a replacement” to which I responded immediately saying that the wedding is gone and I want my money back. I was then told, through email at 3am (I’ve just received it now at 7am) to say “sorry, as this item was worn my manager only approved a replacement”. At 5 am, they dispatched the dress. What is in these people’s mindset to think this is acceptable? I am absolutely disgusted and cannot understand how they think this is ok. I am a single mother who saved hard for a second wedding and wanted to give my daughter the pretty dress she loved. We had to spend twice the price to have a dress on the day and now they want me to have another dress for no reason when it was their issue in the first instance. How can you stand over the quality with the price of these dresses?	2024-07-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66e138dde988e0b08b291e4a	-0.022670807453416156	neutral	["dress", "wedding", "daughter", "another", "till", "tried", "girl", "told", "strap", "worn"]

Her genuine excitement made the brand impossible to ignore, and I knew I had to check it out.Thanks to Sanjana, I discovered a fantastic brand with stunning dresses and a collection that truly stands out. I’m so grateful she introduced me to House of CB—it's now one of my favourite places to shop! I got two summer dresses, when the summer has nearly ended :))!!

The customer service as well is exceptional as I placed my order on Monday and Thursday I had it home (I live in Malta). At first, I panicked when I saw that it would take 3 to 9 wd as I needed the dress within a week. I messaged them on all the social media and they replied immediately. Although they could not change the days of delivery, u received it within 4 days which is amazing. Lastly, I loved the packaging and the instructions for possibly returning it.

They refused to refund to my original payment method and offered a gift card as though I would want to buy anything from these scammers again. They said it was goodwill. I can tell from other reviews this company do nothing on goodwill. THE DRESS WAS FAULTY. They also keep ignoring my request for postage refund. I am going to report them to the trading standards.

Based on my measurements and the site suggestions I got M, but usually I wear XS to S. after confirming with the support i got M; and unfortunately it was way, way too big. That is one star off.The color, quality, thoughtful details were amazing, but probably not for my body shape :( I decided to return the dress, hot confirmation from the store next day it arrived and received moneyback in 3 working days.

7295	houseofcb	Jeanie	After placing my order for a dress I had been trying to get my hands on for a while, I decided to look at the trust pilot reviews and was horrified with what I saw. From the comments, I got really scared that my order will never arrive, that the dress will be damaged and that’ll never get my money worth. However, my experience was completely the opposite. I placed my order on a Saturday afternoon, so was not expecting anything until the next week. On the Wednesday evening, the dress still hadn’t shipped, so I emailed customer service, which promptly responded to me in less than 24h, explaining that the dress was being transferred from the overseas depot since it was the only place the dress was available at the moment. I had managed to order a normally out of order item, really hard to get, so I completely understood. They promptly mentioned that as soon as it will reach the UK depot, they will ship it with the 24h service, which they did. Unfortunately my delivery fell during a bank holiday weekend, so it took a bit longer to get delivered, but that is absolutely not the company’s fault. The dress arrived perfectly packaged, though a bit wrinkly, but in perfect condition. I was lucky enough to be able to go and try it in in a store beforehand, so I knew which size I needed and I do recommend sizing down if possible. Overall a really good experience and people shouldn’t get scared by the ton of negative reviews on there.	2024-08-27	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66cf61a28a899f5e506daa40	0.1421497584541063	neutral	["dress", "order", "get", "really", "reviews", "scared", "never", "experience", "completely", "service"]

Your sizing is OFF, absolutely OFF. Please make your dress wearable for all body types like other shops, and stop catering for one body type please please please and fix your sizing. Now I have to pay MORE money on top of the $281 I spend to get it hemmed. Also…… why did mine ship from Hong Kong 💀. We are supposed to have a store in Aus???

It also came in a cardboard box, no pretty packaging and as much as the customer service replied, they just said they were out of stock for packaging. Couldn't send me any when it comes in and couldn't guarantee the next dress would be in a box either.The whole experience has been underwhelming. I think I will just try to resell it as it turns out my husband doesn't like it anyway and it was to wear to an event with him.. The postage back is extortionate too.

The customer service was really helpful and fast with my questions. This was my first time ordering and I will definitely do it again. The dresses are expensive but really worth it. My only complaint in this experience it’s with the delivery but it’s not house of CB’s fault .

7303	houseofcb	Consumer	This is directed to the online shop. I've ordered the pink madmoiselle dress in may. Basing on the size chart, I could've ordered a smaller size, yet I chose not to and feared that the dress would be a little big. When it arrived, I tried it on and it was way too small. Also the color was off too. So I decided to send it back. The return was very expensive (due to the dress being so heavy) but everything went well and I received a note from the post office, that my package arrived. So I waited for the return, but it never came. I contacted House of CB and received a response on the 9th of july saying: "We have issued your refund on June 12th for EUR262. Please allow up to 10 days for this refund to hit your account." Anyone with basic math skills knows that this should have happened at least 2 weeks ago. I replied and said that this was in the past and asked when I can expect a refund but I never received a response. Now its late august.

I have not received any emails from this company and did not even receive confirmation of return or refund. My account online says refunded however no money as been refunded into my account.

7305	houseofcb	Angie	First, what I can say about House of Cb is that it is very authentic, there are all kinds of colors, the quality is incredible there is something for all women regardless of your size, your weight you will always end up finding something that will suit you perfectly. In addition, the stores are incredible. I went to the one on Oxford Street and you can feel the pleasant atmosphere that reigns there! All this makes this store diversified, selling quality and real fashion. I already made a huge wish list, can't wait to get more of your dresses 🌴🤍🥥 for my personal experience, I bought the ‘Mademoiselle’ dress in black (lovely), and I have never received so many compliments 🖤 thank you so much ! 😊	2024-07-16	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c4f2e149762af02e46fa26	0.4857142857142857	positive	["quality", "incredible", "something", "first", "say", "house", "authentic", "kinds", "colors", "women"]
7306	houseofcb	SM	This is a genuine review.Do not buy online from this brand!The whole online shopping experience was awful. I never received a confirmation email of my order where I spent over £500 for dresses. Their dresses arrived weirdly packaged and were very heavy to wear so I returned them. Turns out they do not refund sales items and make it sound like they do. The whole online shop refers to easy returns and easy processes but I only received a voucher back. Now I do not want to shop with them again and my money is tied up!!

7308	houseofcb	Vanessa Miller	I wish I read the reviews before ordering there customer services is disgusting. I ordered with next day delivery on the 31st of July I needed the dress for the first. I paid for delivery with Royal Mail.  They didn’t send with Royal Mail they used parcel force the worse delivery company you can possibly us.  They won’t leave the parcel in a safe space.  They’ll leave it at a post office.  I went to the post office they said it had been left at it was there, I went back the next day they again said it hadn’t been delivered. I got my friend to go try and retrieve it again apparently no parcel had been delivered there.  It’s now been over 20 days and house of Cb don’t really care there is no customer service number.  It’s just an email address and there’s no point in that either because they don’t care and don’t respond I asked for a refund because I haven’t received my products I’ve started the same conversation multiple times and I’ve got no where.  I’ve had to go through my bank to try and get my money back. I don’t get how this business is still surviving when it’s basically a large scale scam	2024-08-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c2f63730df2cf0e6d6a0a5	-0.01738095238095238	neutral	["delivery", "parcel", "customer", "next", "day", "royal", "mail", "leave", "post", "office"]
7317	houseofcb	Zack	I had a racist experience at the House of CB store in Stratford Westfield. The staff member, was not only rude but also exhibited blatantly discriminatory behavior towards my partner and me during our return. From the moment we approached the counter, she used no manners and made demands instead of politely assisting us, making us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable.As a brown couple dealing with a white employee, we felt targeted, especially when she insinuated that our return was fraudulent. This kind of treatment is unacceptable and completely unprofessional.House of CB, if you value your customers, you should address this issue promptly. If I don't hear back from you, I will be posting a video of my experience on TikTok to highlight this incident, especially given the current tensions and protests around racial discrimination in the UK.	2024-08-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66b4ad4774d8f12791a7b248	-0.010000000000000005	neutral	["experience", "return", "especially", "racist", "house", "store", "stratford", "westfield", "staff", "member"]
7309	houseofcb	Kamla Kerai	I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the recent purchase I made through your online store. My experience has been deeply disappointing, and I feel compelled to outline the specific issues I encountered:1. **Poor Customer Service**: The sales assistants I interacted with were rude and appeared unfamiliar with your returns policy. This lack of knowledge and courtesy is unacceptable and greatly affected my shopping experience.2. **Incorrect Sizing**: The sizes of the dresses I ordered were entirely inaccurate. I typically wear a size 8/10, but the medium-sized dresses I received did not fit the upper part of my body properly. Out of the three dresses, only one fit somewhat adequately, and even that required alterations.3. **Refusal of Credit Note**: I attempted to request a credit note for my online purchase, but this was refused because the items were on sale. However, I would like to remind you that under the Consumer Rights Act (or equivalent legislation in UK sale items must still be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described. Your refusal to issue a credit note is a violation of my consumer rights.Given the above, I am requesting the following resolution:- A full refund or a credit note for the items that were not as described and did not fit properly.- An apology for the poor service I received and a commitment to improve your customer service and staff training.Please respond within 7 days to confirm how you will resolve this matter. If I do not receive a satisfactory response, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint to the relevant consumer protection authorities and consider legal action.I look forward to your prompt response.Yours sincerely,  Kamla	2024-08-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66c0559580b76dd779c9b1ce	0.03266666666666666	neutral	["fit", "credit", "note", "service", "dresses", "items", "consumer", "purchase", "online", "poor"]

The zip was tight, and so this was not due to being the incorrect size.I bought the dress to attend a wedding, and re-ordered the same dress again as it was clear the initial item I was sent was faulty.The second dress that arrived was exactly the same size, but looked completely different and did not have the same issue with the excess material.I explained this to their Customer Service team who told me that the first item wasn’t faulty, and that I had ordered the incorrect size and therefore wouldn’t refund me for the returns postage fee.I sent photos of both items to them - exactly the same dress, in exactly the same size and there were clear, significant differences between the two.Unfortunately they have refused to refund me for the cost of returning the first item, even though it’s clear the initial item was faulty.Awful customer service, send faulty items of poor quality - do not buy!	2024-08-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66be67fad22850e7c301d511	0.06560559006211181	neutral	["item", "dress", "sent", "faulty", "clear", "exactly", "size", "excess", "even", "incorrect"]

Ordered a dress, it arrived with a fault in the fabric, and multiple threads all over the dress, and really bad stitching the quality for the price is so very poor! The dress arrived on the Friday, had a wedding on the Sunday, on the Sunday when I tried it on just before the wedding I noticed all of the scagging/faults in the fabric along the bottom of the dress, but had no other option so had to wear it. I videoed and took photos of all of the faults BEFORE I took the tag off. I sent an email, explained the situation, provided all of the evidence of the faults, sent it back to them, and they are refusing to refund me because it was worn (totally irrelevant as the faults were present before I wore it) and I explained in my initial enquiry that it had been worn and sent them to videos and pictures. SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy better quality items elsewhere at a fraction of the cost. Its ludicrous what they charge for what they are providing, and the customer service or lack of is awful. I have had to send it back at my own cost, and repeatedly chase up for a response. I will be taking this further, and definitely would not recommend or buy from them again. Disappointed as I spent a lot of money which I saved to purchase this item but wanted something of a good quality that I could wear time and time again.

I’m usually a medium or small in actual high end designers like prada, dolce, Versace , Balmain etc. and tell me how this brand a LARGE would still fit tight? So they use 10 year old girls as their size guide? Also horrible horrible stitch shaping, they must also use a 10 year old girl for shaping their clothes. The pants would fit super tight on the butt and very loose on the waist, corset tops were horrendous. They fold up and don’t keep their shape. Even the woman attending me in Nordstrom says they absolutely suck at sizing,that everyone hates it. But now it makes sense why the rackets were full with no one buying.

Nothing was too much trouble for her, and within minutes she had sourced the correct size and had organised a 24hr delivery whilst also arranging collection of the original dress!! When the dress arrived she had taken the time to write a handwritten note to my daughter wishing her a lovely time at the wedding.Well done Luna, I can't thank you enough...A true asset to the company, and for me is now the benchmark for any customer service situation I encounter in the future.Many thanks, Gavin Smith	2024-07-13	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/669e9c11cf3e70e5dd298ac5	0.13022916666666667	neutral	["dress", "customer", "service", "received", "daughter", "nothing", "original", "size", "called", "luna"]

I am a size 12-14 usually but unfortunately did not fit in any of the size L dresses, there was one I absolutely love but it would not fit and they do not stock a larger size. The L+ they offer is aimed at a larger size but mainly increases the bust size, something I don't need.

7340	houseofcb	Bk	Their website is misleading - the prices are listed in AUD and without taxes or GST. I realised this only at checkout when 10% cost was added. This is illegal in Australia according to the ACCC. Nowhere on the website does it state that they charge in GBP, not in AUD. I was charged $26 extra because their exchange rate was not accurate. I expect that because prices were advertised in AUD, that the price on the invoice would be the same that was charged on my bank statement. I think that is a fair expectation. the invoice does not reflect the charge at all. I contacted House of CB and reminded them of Australian consumer laws. They did not care, did not offer a refund of the difference when asked to.	2024-07-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6699de19da042aabc4b2c67e	-1.586032892321652e-17	neutral	["aud", "website", "prices", "charge", "charged", "invoice", "misleading", "listed", "without", "taxes"]
7341	houseofcb	Erin	I wish I could give 0 stars. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I ordered and wore a $250 dress to a wedding 1 time and the stitching came out of both straps that night. For the price of these dresses that should NEVER happen. I payed $20 to return the dress, I marked it as faulty and asked for it to be reviewed. I was told they would recover the repair costs for up to $30 and they sent it back to me NOT repaired. I was a loyal consistent customer. I have ordered many dresses from them and I did not deserve or appreciate the way they handled this. I will never order from them again.	2024-07-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66998cb00ecb04dc308baa06	0.14047619047619048	neutral	["customer", "ordered", "dress", "dresses", "never", "wish", "could", "give", "stars", "worst"]
7342	houseofcb	Rosy	Ordered the size medium Analissa dress and unfortunately was too small despite me checking the measurements on their website. That being said, my personal experience of delivery and returning the item went smoothly. Delivery of dress to my home address was quick and I returned the dress with a tracked Evri delivery which cost me about £3 (I am in the UK). I have just had my refund (4 days after my return was delivered back to House of CB). I was worried after reading all the reviews on here so I took photos of the dress with all the tags attached just incase. My experience with dealing with them has been positive, just a shame about the sizing!	2024-07-18	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6699330311dbf78d55c8c7eb	0.0382034632034632	neutral	["dress", "delivery", "experience", "ordered", "size", "medium", "analissa", "unfortunately", "small", "despite"]

7345	houseofcb	Jovana	I ordered a dress for my friends wedding, the order was placed on the 7th of July (said 2-3 working days for delivery). Its the 15th of July and they apparently tried to deliver it today, this is not true as i was at home all day and successfully recieved parcels from other companies. Apparently they left me a note - there was no note. I am travelling 3 days and wont be at home during the day in the meantime so i have no time to reschedule the delivery. It was my first time ordering something from their website so had a discount code to use (which i did), however i now have to go into the store tomorrow and waste my time on queuing etc to but rhe same exact dress and somehow get the original one returned somehow. This has caused a lot of inconvenience and stress. I want my online discount code matched in store as this is not my fault that it hasnt arrived in time as it has been more than 2-3 business days.

It's now 6 working days later and I have received no update about my order and it just shows as "shipping" despite the dress and corset both showing as out of stock online. I've tried to contact House of CB via email and Facebook but no one has responded to me despite the "you'll receive an answer within 48 hours" message. I ordered with plenty of time for my event on Friday, with the cost being almost £300!

7359	houseofcb	Elif Naz Bozkurt	0 stars would have been more appropriate but sadly it’s not possible. Had the worst experience of my life, WAITED FOR AN HOUR FOR A REFUND AND COULDN’T EVEN RETURN THE ITEM. It’s so sad that it’s almost funny at this point.I bought two items from Stratford House of CB store (massive queue for dressing rooms) but due to the queue and me having a life, therefore not having the time to wait there for an hour, I bought two items without trying. One of them was too tight so I decided to return it but I was told I had to go to one of their stores so that’s how I ended up at Oxford Street store.The first thing I noticed was the queue and I asked someone if I need to wait that queue if I was only returning an item and I was told to wait. After about 20 minutes and seeing only two people actually being served I knew the situation was hopeless but I had to wait to get my money back.I could see people waiting at the cashier and as I got close I saw that they were basically waiting for at least 10-15 minutes for items to be delivered from the basement or wherever they are keeping the dresses at. For a company that has hundreds if not thousands of dresses, imagine one person going and looking for 10 dresses… Then if that person manages to find the dresses in the next 15 minutes they finally stop chatting with customers and each other and complete the transaction. If not, another 10 minutes to wait.Finally when it was my turn, they asked for confirmation, learned it was Amex on Apple Pay and said they need to contact Stratford. They couldn’t communicate with their sister store for another 10 minutes straight, made me wait, didn’t help anyone else in the process and just stood there. Once they could communicate, I was given a phone and the person asked for my card details as in my card number and CVV. I didn’t have my physical card with me and even if I did, I wasn’t going to read it out loud in a packed store for everyone to hear, especially on a store in a street that is famous with thefts.They told me to leave the dress with them and they would process it, however, the only confirmation I would receive would be the store manager’s word. After my experience with how the store is being run I wasn’t going to trust anyone’s word, therefore am now at Tottenham Court Road Station with my dress writing this.I don’t suggest anyone to purchase anything from House of CB, I know the dresses are cute my loves but nothing is worth that wait for purchase or that return process.For House of CB, I think the company has great potential but you need to hire professionals for operations side of things, however good your designs look doesn’t matter if your customers are unhappy with your service and if you lose trust. Personally I am traumatised by the experience, will never again go into a store and will definitely not order online in case I would need to return and I see people here not getting their refunds as well.	2024-06-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/667f207bc030bf5888b41ff5	0.05848214285714286	neutral	["store", "wait", "would", "minutes", "return", "queue", "need", "dresses", "experience", "two"]
7360	houseofcb	Karina Caetano	One of my dreams was to graduate wearing a house of CB dress. I started looking around 4 weeks ago and wasn’t sure what I wanted. When the Naia dress came out I knew it was the one! I didn’t feel comfortable purchasing online because I wasn’t sure what size I would be (I recently lost 45kg and still struggle to guess if I’d fit in something). I drove 2 hours to go to the Oxford St store. The dress I wanted was from the new collection, it wasn’t even on the main floor yet. The staff kindly got the dress from the stock room, steamed it and allowed me to try the dress on. Special shout out to Kiara who hyped me up after seeing my before/after pictures with weight loss. As the dress wasn’t yet available in store, I tried purchasing online but it was going to be 6-8 business days to deliver (I needed it for that week). The amazing team pulled through and allowed me to purchase my dream dress for my graduation. I cannot thank them enough for making this possible.

Keep in mind after the exchange rate, this cost over 400$ cad. We paid 400$ cad for a ripped dress for my girlfriends convocation. So surely I assumed their customer support team would be able to compensate for what is an extremely disappointing failure. Something so bad that I’d likely never consider buying from this store again if the issue wasn’t resolved. They offered to cover the repair costs up to 30$ usd or cover the shipping costs if I chose to return the dress up to 25 usd. Unbelievable. I obviously did not buy the dress with the intent for it to be returned. And there was not enough time to pay to have it repaired. Insanely poor customer service.

Paid an extra €40 in taxes and then had to pay an additional €20 to return the dress, both of which do not get refunded when you return so essentially be prepared to lose €50/€60 just for returning something that doesn’t fit or suit.	2024-06-06	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6661a36e0d17f2e0a10b552d	0.13	neutral	["return", "dresses", "pretty", "definitely", "reflect", "cost", "paid", "extra", "\\u20ac40", "taxes"]

7377	houseofcb	Kala Perry	If I can stop even one person from shopping this brand, I will feel vindicated. House of CB doesn’t have many physical stores so, unfortunately, purchasing online is my only option. I spent over $600 on two dresses for a special event that I have coming up, but, much to my dismay, neither dress fit properly as their sizing is notoriously inconsistent and completely off track from the measurement guide they have on the website. Not to worry though, I’ll just return what I bought and get my money back….Well be warned that House of CB does not offer free returns, which, maybe if I had bought a swimsuit or a simple top, wouldn’t have made much of a difference, but considering I was returning two heavy evening gowns, the price of shipping alone cost me a whopping $75 (which was the cheapest option available to me given by three different shipping services). So, unless you’re willing to take a huge financial loss on something you’ll never be able to wear, I suggest you visit a physical House of CB location to try things on, or just avoid it altogether.	2024-06-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6660b4123254ad7a7f7d0bab	0.15487012987012988	neutral	["house", "physical", "option", "two", "much", "bought", "shipping", "stop", "even", "one"]

I've tried to get in contact with parcel force and house of CB and frankly I'm outraged at how both of them fall so incredibly hard when it comes to client communication, neither of them allow you to speak to actual people and neither of them have any agency to get back to customers. i have never been so bitterly disappointed by a brand, please do better and help us!	2024-05-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/665b15485092a7a77fa8136e	-0.1880952380952381	negative	["order", "house", "dress", "got", "never", "tried", "get", "neither", "adored", "shop"]

7385	houseofcb	Mrs j	Visited the London Oxford St store to return 2 dresses bought online. Queue was long but 4 people serving so thought it would be relatively quick as only 2 people in front of us. However 45 mins later finally served and no eye contact or apologies for the wait. When got to front of queue, was then told returns only dealt with by manager. So waited again whilst manager dealt with customer in front but once sorted the sale, she proceeded to put hangars and cloths back rather than delegate to the other assistants who were in background and not able to use tills. She then walked off with no acknowledgment of people waiting and trying to get the queues down. It seemed like she was avoiding any contact despite people now getting quite exasperated with the long wait. Nobody on the tills gave any sort of apologies for the waits and what was the hold up.  4 servers quickly then went down to just 1. Customer who was being served as she had been waiting an hour so she left stating normally very patient but was ridiculous waiting for 1 hour to buy just 2 items.  Other customers then started questioning who was actually serving as staff there but nobody at tills. Finally another mangager came but too interested in adjusting his earpiece to really focus on job at hand. He served us but again, no conversation or apologies for wait. Handed back my receipts and said all done but when I checked, seen he’d refunded the wrong item and had actually refunded the more expensive dress and even when pointed this out, no apologies or thank you for returning to sort. He then said that they owed me to which I corrected him saying I owed them £110! Was the worst experience I have ever had in store. Given these were supposed managers, then think headquarters need to retrain them in how to deal with customers and perhaps review the way they deal with long queues and how they delegate packing/clearing clothes duties. If only managers can sort refunds and exchanges then maybe have a dedicated side of till with clear signage so allowing 2 queues and avoid frustration. Having better queuing arrangement would also be useful as was very unclear how to queue around the displayed dresses which led to some queue-jumping.	2024-05-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6651eeaeb148360194406c29	-0.015235690235690236	neutral	["people", "apologies", "queue", "long", "front", "served", "wait", "tills", "waiting", "queues"]
7386	houseofcb	Lauren Fox	I had a good online experience. I ordered the tatiana dress and it arrived within the expected delivery time frame. The quality was lovely but, unfortunately, the cup size was too big. For reference, I ordered a size S (larger cup) and I am usually a size UK 6-8, D cup. Other than the cup size, the dress fit perfectly. I was aware that you had to pay the cost of your return delivery. This cost £12.15 with Royal Mail. The bulk of the cost is to insure the item if it gets lost. This is more than I anticipated but I can’t complain as it wasn’t something I looked at before placing my order. What worried me most is that, after placing my order, I saw the Trustpilot reviews stating that people weren’t getting their refunds. I received notification of my refund within 3 days of the dress being delivered back to them. So I would just say, if you’re looking after your return while it’s in your possession, not to worry about this. My experience is that House of CB is a trustworthy company selling good quality items and I would order from them again. Instead though, I’m going to travel to a store so I can try on a few different dresses and sizes without the return cost.	2024-05-24	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6650b0545ad8ddf2219a7a80	0.19852941176470587	neutral	["cup", "size", "cost", "dress", "return", "order", "good", "experience", "ordered", "within"]

My boyfriend who had waited with me and was going to be the one paying, had to wait at the other side of the store whilst I tried them on. And instead of taking on this feedback (which I hadn’t shared aggressively, was just sharing my experience for other buyers) they BLOCKED my account. Clearly trying to erase any bad reviews!

They informed me the  return was received and I've had a full refund in my bank account within 2 days.I've read some of the negative reviews about returns and refunds. They very clearly state on their website that returns are at your own expense, they give suggestions on which courier service you should use and that sale items are not eligible for refund but a gift card to use on a different item. All info is there for customers to make an informed decision. I also liked that they send you a note making you aware to not soil the garment with make up/fake tan when trying on and not tamper the tags. To me this shows good quality control as I wouldn't want to receive a dress that's not in perfect condition if someone else tried it on previously. I will order a 3rd and final dress which has cup size and I'm confident it will fit me perfectly!	2024-05-01	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66335d84e951686e4dbc5b66	0.31953333333333334	positive	["dresses", "quality", "day", "fit", "perfectly", "ive", "service", "informed", "refund", "returns"]

I got a nasty look and “we do say to be careful cause there’s a mark on the dress”. Honestly I’d hold my hands up if it was ruined, but there were little marks, the fabric of it was a magnet to anything too.Refused a refund, and sent it off under faulty as the stitching was actually coming away from it.No refund, just a brand new dress sent back to me that I don’t need.Just a note, if you try the dresses on, make sure you’re not wearing deodorant 🤯 and note they’re extremely precious about giving money back.	2024-04-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/662e06c3d188c8da0b696940	-0.008933566433566438	neutral	["dress", "actually", "deodorant", "dresses", "went", "asked", "refund", "sent", "back", "note"]

7410	houseofcb	Clara Hanson Smith	Tried the 3 for £160 deal as a first time customer who’s always wanted the dresses. I  bought 3 dresses and £160 came out my account. I then get an email come through that my order is out for delivery but there is only 2 dresses in the email? I’m confused but just assumed it must be an error. The package arrives and there’s only 1 dress??? I contact them and they say it’s due to stock so they were unable to fulfill the order - yet I was still charged for them. I had to fight for a refund for the dress that wasn’t on the delivery email but they wanted me to fill out a form for the other missing dress. They wanted me to print out a sheet however I do not own a printer. I stated this and they have left me on seen for a week. The only dress I received clasp had been bent out of shape so I couldn’t even wear it. I ordered this in preparation for a wedding and ended up rushing around the day befor because I had no dress. It’s really appalling.	2024-04-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/662604eaa1ce902d691820a9	-0.14583333333333334	negative	["dress", "wanted", "dresses", "email", "\\u00a3160", "order", "delivery", "tried", "deal", "first"]
7411	houseofcb	Sarah Watson	Been a customer for years and current customer service is terrible. Ordered a dress and it arrived dirty and had a hole it. It was brand new with label and security tag. This is not the first time this has happened either. I have spent probably over £10,000 with this company between my accounts over the years. Reached out to their team on email and Instagram and have been waiting for over a month to get a resolution. I still have yet to receive a concrete reply. No attempts to remedy the situation or even offer a discount code for all the trouble.	2024-04-20	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/66236946f173b4bc75eb101f	-0.1704545454545455	negative	["customer", "years", "current", "service", "terrible", "ordered", "dress", "arrived", "dirty", "hole"]

They managed to find a solution and very efficiently had my package resent.

Don’t publish the fabric content on their website (a big red flag) as when you arrive you discover that they are all low quality, cheap fabrics that look and feel cheap - scratchy. Sizing is lazy - e.g. super long sleeves on an XS.I received a refund from CB very quickly - within a few days - but note that, had I ordered the same thing a day later, when it went on sale, I would have been limited to get store credit.	2024-01-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6616a81637c78250b3191d4f	0.03301587301587302	neutral	["quality", "dress", "cheap", "house", "despite", "expensive", "brand", "publish", "fabric", "content"]

I guess that’s why it’s called the sale season, they are just trying to empty their old stocks because i ordered a top and skirt, and the stitchings are messy and easily undone. It’s from their old lines i supposed. Luckily I ordered one of their new spring dresses ‘Elida’ and that one is lovely. Although the other one ‘Imani’ i’ve ordered is always out of stock and seems like it’s on preorder. Still waiting for that one to be shipped. However, their customer support takes ages to reply.

7423	houseofcb	Lauren Ashcroft	This company will send you a faulty dress and then refuse to refund you for it. They will accept that the goods are faulty by way of attempting to send you a replacement (and informing you that you have no rights to return that replacement), but will refuse to refund. I purchased a beautiful dress and was really disappointed when the stitching came away. My grandma was a seamstress so I know poor stitching when I see it! I returned expecting a full refund and even ordered the dress again because I loved it so much. They are a nightmare to deal with and straight away took days to come back to me. It seemed that the person in the messenger chat (which seems to be the only way to contact them. No one replied to my email and they don’t have phone lines etc) said my matter was being reviewed by a manager and they would come back to me. They didn’t come back to me so I was left with no choice but to contact my card issuer. When I told them that I had ordered a replacement and expected a full refund (and that I had even ordered a replacement). They completely ignored what I had said and stated that they had sent me a replacement! So they expected me to keep two of the same dress!! I don’t know why they are so reluctant to refund me. Perhaps the company doesn’t have the funds. Either way, save your time and money and shop at a company that is not bogus and will not act in contravention of the law and your consumer rights. I am still going through my card issuer to get my refund and I will not give up.	2024-04-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/660fb073cd44650053661699	0.07794117647058822	neutral	["refund", "replacement", "dress", "company", "way", "ordered", "come", "back", "send", "faulty"]

So, I dragged my sister and cousins along for a prom dress hunt, and man, did we hit the jackpot! The staff at the store were super chill and made us feel right at home. They even remembered my name, which was a nice touch.I gotta give props to the staff for their awesome advice on sizing. They were all about that 'if you can zip it up yourself, size down' rule, and let me tell you, it totally worked. My sister found this killer dress that made her look like she owned the place, and she had to size down—mind blown!Honestly, the whole vibe at the store was just so friendly and laid-back. And the dresses? Don't even get me started. It was like walking into a fashion dreamland. Needless to say, we left with a couple of dresses, and you can bet I'll be back for more.

They were too busy holding a staff training and meeting to help you with queries or serve at the tills. When I finally got service I purchased two dresses. The lady serving me couldn’t tie the ribbons so after waiting about 20 minutes for her to wrap them up, she gave up (without even asking me) and didn’t package it as it should have been. Part of the purchase is a luxury service and wrapping which I didn’t get. On one dress it clearly states on the label £179. On my receipt it says £189. They overcharged me by £10- every dress they have in that style lists the same price (179) on all of the tags. After calling multiple times they managed to refund me. To top it off the sales dress I purchased has no washing label and just has a label saying ‘sample’ which I’m sure is illegal to sell a sample without disclosing it?

The structure of the dress leaves a lot to be desired, it feels like fast fashion, the lace is horrendous quality - I have bought better for a 10th of the price, & my bolero arrived damaged with two huge threads pulled. It is SHEER, nude underwear will still be seen. All in all, nice from afar but far from nice.

7434	houseofcb	ELISE	A few days ago, by coincidence, I came across this brand and really liked its design. So I found out that I can order it on the Nordstrom website in the US and the Houseofcb website in the UK. I placed orders on these two websites separately, and here is my experience:The products I ordered on the Nordstrom website required payment of taxes. The delivery was done by LaserShip (OnTrac) and arrived in about 3 working days. The products were packaged in plastic bags, and manufactured in the Philippines. The clothing designs were beautiful, and the material was good, but as described by others, the workmanship of the products was not fine enough. There were many loose threads on the clothes. I believe that for a $255 dress, such loose threads should not be present, and it should not be up to the customer to deal with them.I ordered 2 products from the Houseofcb website, where the clothes were also manufactured in the Philippines and shipped from there via UPS, arriving in 3 working days. This time, there were no customs duties charged. The products were packaged in gift boxes, the material of the clothes was good, but the workmanship of the products was not fine enough. There were many loose threads on the clothes. I believe that for a $255 dress, such loose threads should not be present, and it should not be up to the customer to deal with them. They don't even meet the quality and attention to detail of a $100 dress made in China.Overall, I really like the design, style, and fabric of this brand.	2024-03-15	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65f6ba93862f40c026d54ef6	0.15628205128205125	neutral	["products", "website", "loose", "threads", "clothes", "days", "dress", "brand", "really", "design"]

Keep in mind the dress was brand new, never washed, still in its box with the tag on and everything. After back and forth with the customer service for nearly two months because they never get back to you on time and always take super long to respond they said they can't do anything for me. So now I'm stuck with a $350 dress that I can't do anything with. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. They tried to tell me they can't do anything because the dress is washed which I know is a lie. They just keep throwing excuses at me. I thought for such as expensive dress and a "high end" brand they would care about their customer but no. Don't purchase from them.

7442	houseofcb	CJP	In relation to my order 7254084 I have been completely let down by House of CB. I received a faulty item. (A dress of £180). The item arrived with lots of pulls in the material and loose thread. I immediately contacted customer services via Facebook messenger, which started off fine. They said I can return this for a refund and that they would reimburse me for posting this back to them, if a manufacturing issue was confirmed and they would then refund me. Which is fair enough and completely fine. So I taken all photos. I was reading trust pilot to see if this has happened to anyone else, I noticed lots of reviews accusing customers of wear and removing tags. Luckily I also taken photos with all the tags still attached to the dress. This is where it went down hill. I had to keep chasing customer services for weeks as I saw it had been delivered back to them and signed for, but I had no updates. After ignoring my messages on messenger several times, as it said ‘seen’, they finally replied to say that a replacement item was already on the way and that I could not return this replacement for an exchange or return… ??????  I did not want sn exchange, I bought this dress for my Birthday which I did not get to wear. I didn’t even try the dress on initially, so they’re sending me a replacement I’m going to be stuck with if this didn’t fit? It was also no longer required. So I contacted them again, to explain this. That I was offered a refund and they’ve send me a non-refundable replacement without my permission? So they’re going against consumer law and trading standards with this, refusing me a refund even though their item arrived damaged this unfit or purpose and not as described. I am now looking at citizens advice as this also clearly states that customers are entitled for a refund in these circumstances. To make this even worse, when the dress arrived yesterday, it also has loose threads in the material which is clearly a common fault in the dress? I am now asking them to provide me with return instructions so that I can return this for a refund but they are of course ignoring me and when they do reply it is very short and rude replies. I have never had to complain about a company as I’ve never had this issues. Imagine being stuck with a dress that was supposed to be for your birthday, that is faulty, doesn’t fit (as I didn’t even try on the first dress I sent back) and is of extreme poor quality. They do not care whatsoever. I will now have to escalate this further and seek some help from higher levels as I can’t afford to be at a loss. As the company is being so callous about the whole situation I don’t think I will ever shop here again. The company do have some nice items that I have worn in the past. I’ve recommended them to friends and family so I am gutted to be honest. Their policy is practically illegal that they refuse to offer refund for faulty items.	2024-02-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65ec0d46d14e161e01e180bd	0.07137380593262946	neutral	["dress", "refund", "item", "return", "also", "replacement", "even", "faulty", "arrived", "back"]

7445	houseofcb	kate huttemann	f I could give a score of 0 stars I would.  I purchased a dress from House of CB for my senior prom using my own money. My prom is in May 2024.  I ordered the dress in January to have plenty of time to return it in case it didn't fit. The dress did not fit, and I returned it having met all of the return requirements posted on the company's website. They refused my return, stating that it did not meet some requirement concerning a "security ribbon" that wasn't even listed on their website.  It seems to me that they are trying to use some sort of return policy loop hole (only provided in very fine print on the return sheet) to refuse to honor their own return policy (provided on their website).  Buyer beware!  I've never seen or heard of a "security ribbon" on an article of clothing.  If you purchase from House of CB, make sure you have all of your documentation in order or you will not be able to get a return for merchandise that doesn't fit.	2024-02-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65d3567d2e68389f3aec5dba	0.38796296296296295	positive	["return", "dress", "fit", "website", "house", "prom", "security", "ribbon", "policy", "provided"]

When the items arrived, we realised that the quality was no where near what you would expect for clothes of this cost. Both items really were only worth about £30 each. They returns policy does not take into account your customer rights. They request that the return is made via the post office and that the signed for service with tracking is used, at a high cost which you are expected to pay. I contacted House of DB and was told that they don't cover the return cost. Even though they should under the customer rights act. There must be many other companies who provide better quality clothing for more reasonable prices and who actually care about their customers. Avoid House of CB, they are rubbish.	2023-12-12	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65c789e5e77ff8f0bc1bdd18	0.17450000000000004	neutral	["cost", "high", "items", "quality", "customer", "rights", "return", "house", "ordered", "hoodie"]
7453	houseofcb	MH	I'd recently bought a dress which ended up being very clumsily fitted and kept slipping upwards at the hem. I've tried my dress on but didn't wear it, but just because I'd detached their ribbon label, they now refuse to issue me a refund. Their store manager in Oxford st. took my dress off me to take back to the warehouse without issuing me my refund. she as extremely condescending and the employees were sneering at me. Their customer service and quality is an absolute disgrace despite charging me £179 for a dress I'll never wear because of its cheap quality that isnt functional not wearable at all as it keeps slipping because it's too short. I've escalated this to Resolver but would advise against ever purchasing clothes from HouseofCB as their shopping experience is extremely stressful. The product is NOT as described and is faulty and they are blatantly violating the Consumer Rights Act 2015 by withholding refunds. It's not like a hygiene product that can't be refunded because the label has been detached; it's a dress that isn't anything like it was advertised to be.

7455	houseofcb	Heather Brown-lyon	This company single-handed resolved a decades long dilemma for big busted women: how to find dresses that support our frames and have adjustable waste bands. As a petite frame with large, heavy natural breast… finding a dress was a nightmare. I’d try on thousands, only to settle for mediocre at best… totally unsupported and hating all photos of me. It started a massive body insecurity in me for years. I loathed the dressing room… until I tried on my first house of CB dress that perfectly sinched in my petite waste and supported my large chest. I cried tears of joy. It wasn’t MY body that was the issue… it was the dress makers failing to design dresses to fit it well. Until house of CB!

7461	houseofcb	Claudia Aguilar	If I could give 0 stars, I would. Received a gift from a family member for my birthday in which is after the holiday season. Since my birthday gift was purchased with Christmas gifts, I received this when it was already outside of the 28 day exchange time frame. It didn't fit and I reached out knowing of the policy, so kindly asked for some sort of courtesy / assistance to just exchange the size. No refund not return, just a size exchange. I received no options what-so-ever and was told multiple times what the policy is from different team members as if they didn’t read the email thread nor communicate my inquire. Meaningless back and forth.. eventually I asked about management and showed frustration at the fact that I kept having to repeat the same thing and now I have yet to hear back. As you may notice this brand is not cheap, nor is it domestic so exchanges are already at my own cost for shipping which I was willing to do as normal just to get a product that fits. They wouldn’t have had to do or lose anything, I simple wanted a size exchange of a still existing product on their site and was pretty much told that it’s my loss. Not happy with the service provided at all. I would expect more form a company of this significance.	2024-01-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65baba7418bd9c0e1e29a13b	0.09736842105263156	neutral	["exchange", "received", "size", "would", "gift", "birthday", "already", "policy", "asked", "told"]
7462	houseofcb	Marina M	I paid over €270 (£232.47) for a dress that never came. It was supposedly arriving on the 5th of January and required a signature, which is why I planned on working from home that day to receive it. On the 4th of January (a day earlier), I received an email claiming my package was delivered. I waited to come home and see if it was there but it wasn’t. I ask all my neighbours on the same street if they had my package by any chance and none of them had it, so I filed a complaint. The complaint with UPS took over 10 days to be resolved WITHOUT updating me. I had to look for the information myself, calling them to know it was lost 24 days earlier. They told me I have to contact house of CB to resolve the matter. While UPS claims that they told the shipper that the parcel was lost, House of CB claims it was delivered and I’m now asked to share my ID with them so they can take on my claim and investigate more. If it wasn’t for the price of the dress, I would have given up already but there’s no way I’m getting scammed of close to €300 without putting a fight and exposing the company.Either House of CB or UPS is lying. No matter what, I will not order there again and would recommend everyone to stay away if they can’t buy in the shop. I was really excited about this dress as it is the original dress that all the fast fashion sites are copying. Now I regret not just finding the dupe on SheIn.

7463	houseofcb	Cj	Been customer of Houseofcb for few years now, owned many dresses and tops from them. And I can say the sizes are very inconsistent, almost all the the clothing I bought from them I have to go to sewing lady and fix it. When things go wrong customer service is unreliable like literally!!! Every message take a day or 2 before they answer back and eventually they stop answering at all. So I ended up having a dress that I could not wear and couldn't return either (return date passed still no help or answer) because I thought they would be able to sort out through customer service both in Instagram and Facebook. Forget the email customer service because they won't answer back either. So ordering from them is a gamble really and when things go wrong thats it, so I would save myself from stress and frustration shopping from them , no more Houseofcb on my side.	2023-11-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65ba1aac497cd826d3c3ab2e	-0.05265625	neutral	["customer", "service", "answer", "houseofcb", "things", "wrong", "back", "return", "either", "would"]

7467	houseofcb	Meg Johnson	Do not order from House of CB, they will not refund you for items that become faulty and unwearable on first wear. Ordered a cashmere set, Nereida and Adelita model and I was really excited to wear as it was my christmas present. Wore for the first time to run a quick errand and the trousers bobbled so badly within 40 mins of wear to the point I wouldn’t wear them again. Spent £10 to send them back. I kept the jumper as it wouldn’t be subjected to the same amount of wear as trousers are and it’s obviously a material issue. They got back to me and said they can only send me a new pair and can’t give me a refund as they’ve been worn. This is a fault I wouldn’t have known of unless I wore them. As it’s a material quality issue the new ones will most likely do the exact same thing. Really disappointed to also see so many other reviews saying the same and also that I’ve had money spent on a Christmas present I can’t wear.EDIT: got sent a new pair they did the exact same thing bobbled really badly in first day of wear. The reply from House of CB on this review is not fully truthful I was only offered replacement not store credit. Would’ve taken store credit as it’s an obvious material issue with the one product I ordered.	2024-01-17	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65a79947cbb5b8d8596d3e35	0.06749755620723363	neutral	["wear", "first", "really", "material", "issue", "new", "house", "refund", "ordered", "christmas"]
7474	houseofcb	Sarah	Ordered a pair of leggings from House of Cb, they didn't fit. original price £109, in sale for £89. sent back - i received acknowledgement email back and message saying they have sent me a gift card with £89! i paid on my debit card. after 2 weeks of complaining through emails, putting in investigation with my bank to dispute the payment and reverse it, i got a response saying as " a good will gesture" they will refund me via my ORIGINAL payment. Can i just explain something to all house of cb customers. House of CB has an ILLEGAL refund policy within the uk. the sales of goods act covers all consumers if Z product is not fit for purpose and you send it back in original condition within the time frame you are entitled to a FULL refund via the ORIGINAL payment method. Don't be pushed over by sales assistants emailing you incorrect information. They don't in fact make you tick a box at the end of a transaction saying returned sales items are credit note only. I did in fact receive acknowledgement saying we have you return and will process your refund via original payment. Please Buyers be aware House Of CB cant dictate how they refund you, that's like a customer sending back a old sock instead of the original dress and saying yeah well that's my personal send back policy! jokers. They need investigating for this. Buyers stick by the law and not what , these fools tell you. By law if a product is not suitable you are entitled to a FULL refund via original method of payment if HOCB dont play ball, raise a chargeback with your bank or contact the financial ombudsman.	2024-01-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/659ed03facbf66a5db2d17d6	0.15833333333333335	neutral	["original", "refund", "back", "saying", "payment", "house", "via", "sales", "dont", "fit"]

7477	houseofcb	Connor	The short story: this company flat out refuses to offer refunds (which is illegal), and you will have to file a complaint with Resolver to get your money back if you want a refund. It will take time and be very stressful. We are unfortunately the latest of many cases like this, based on previous reviews. DO NOT shop with this company. We are currently dealing with this extremely sleazy company, and have subsequently educated ourselves on UK consumer law - which states that when making an online purchase (distance selling), a customer has the right for 14 days to cancel the order after receiving the items (the customer does not need to give a reason), and return the items for a refund. It is also illegal to mislead consumers about their rights regarding this, which they are doing on their shop website - this is all clearly stated on the GOV UK website.This company has been violating that law since we started dealing with them. My wife received 2 dresses (ordered 3 but the third one never even showed up). They were not good quality, the cup on one of them was also bent out of shape. We have asked to return them for a refund. This company is completely ignoring our requests - we are giving them GOV.UK links over email stating the law, asking clearly for a refund, and they have been delaying and ignoring our requests for a week now, stating that they "can't offer refunds".They have finally pretended they are doing us a favour by offering us an "exchange or gift card refund", which isn't good enough, especially since UK law entitles us to a cash refund. They are fighting us every step of the way to issue a refund - there is no end in sight and we are now going to have to use Resolver for our refund complaint, as many people have said they have had to do in previous reviews. We will also be complaining to the authorities about this experience, as it is blatantly illegal for them to be doing this. To anyone reading: please learn from our experience - do not shop with this company. This is the worst experience I have ever had when dealing with a retailer. The clothes are not good quality, it isn't worth all this stress, and we are now short hundreds of pounds until we receive our refund. Just shop with someone else, and know your rights as a customer.	2024-01-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6597e64fda4e8b89fff58302	-0.046800595238095245	neutral	["refund", "company", "shop", "law", "illegal", "dealing", "customer", "also", "good", "experience"]

7479	houseofcb	Abbie	Ordered a dress from house of CB for the holidays weeks ago. As soon as I ordered, despite saying the dress was in stock on the website I received an email saying it was out of stock and would be back ordered. I was disappointed but decided to keep the order and repurpose the dress for another event in January as the restock date was 20th December. On the 20th December the dress populated for sale on the website but STILL has not dispatched. Only by emailing them was I informed there was a delay and I had to really push to be told that the delay could take weeks yet again.I am being offered a refund but no real estimate on when I could actually get my dress. Have to say this has been a very disappointing experience. I can’t even comment on the quality of the clothes because they aren’t arriving!I was really excited to receive this dress in time for my 30th birthday so and it has resulted in a let down, so I don’t think I will be using house of cb again.	2023-12-27	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/658bf9f2a65736416e421e72	-0.11005050505050505	negative	["dress", "ordered", "house", "weeks", "saying", "stock", "website", "20th", "december", "delay"]

7491	houseofcb	Mom	I wish I would have listened to all of the other reviews. Be very careful when ordering. I ordered according to their size chart the dress would not zip up, according to them because it’s a corset. Not sure why being a corset would matter. You need to adjust your size chart per item if that is the case. Having a lot of issues receiving refund. They drag their feet. On top of it, you are responsible for return shipping, with signature and tracking. Not inexpensive! Read the reviews and be careful.	2023-11-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/656cbdfdc776b1c4e06fe0c3	0.00642857142857143	neutral	["would", "reviews", "careful", "according", "size", "chart", "corset", "wish", "listened", "ordering"]

So its all just marketing, if you buy and doesn't fit thats it, only countless emails and lies. At this point 7 January 2024 i dont know where my dress is and if i will receive it back, once the holidays are over i will again contact spain post and macedonian post to try to find it.

7483	houseofcb	Galina Shatunova	When I first came across the site I thought it was love at first sight. Photos of models, full description of the product, what it goes with. Fairy tale. Plus a really decent selection of beautiful clothes. IN FACT. I took a satin dress (KATE ORCHID SATIN WRAP FRONT MINI DRESS), in the description on the website only satin is indicated, without polyester. I also bought a suit: “check Wool, Stretch Cotton” (MISTRESS ROCKS BROWN CHECK OVERSIZED BLAZER + jacket xs turned out to be too big, even taking into account the oversize). The tag again says 80% polyester, the dress is 100%. Overall, things look good, but there are questions about the QUALITY of the material. Without the discount, the dress costs $269. For that kind of money I didn't expect to get CHEAP POLYESTER. Shoes (PARIS 5' TAUPE PATENT LEATHER POINTY TOE HEELS) are also very nice in appearance. Size 38 is a little too small (than it should be) and narrow. Traces of glue are visible on the sole. I didn’t return anything, since all the products are needed + delivery for the usual return - at my own expense. Especially when you live in USA - super expensive shipping. Pros: large selection, pictures look great. Product description, website. The clothes came in beautiful packaging, like a luxury brand. This made me happy.Cons: non-refundable delivery in case of return. QUALITY OF CLOTHING. If you are positioning yourself as a luxury brand for crazy money, use high-quality materials. Or write a plausible description - so that the person has a choice. Why fool people?I read the reviews after the purchase and was shocked by the number of negative reviews. I never leave reviews, but I couldn't resist here.The holiday mood is slightly spoiled.	2023-12-19	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65839cfd1b9925e5d9cba2fa	0.1653704091607317	neutral	["description", "dress", "satin", "polyester", "return", "reviews", "first", "came", "product", "selection"]
7484	houseofcb	Gentiana Karpuzi	I am writing this review to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the recent service I have experienced from House of CB. My overall interaction with your company has left me thoroughly disappointed.Upon receiving the initial item, I was dismayed to find subpar quality, exemplified by a poorly attached zipper that significantly detracted from the garment's appeal. This is especially disheartening considering House of CB's reputation for delivering quality and stylish products.The subsequent exchange process, initiated promptly within 24 hours, has been marred by significant delays beyond reasonable expectations. This extended processing time contradicts the efficiency one would anticipate from House of CB and has inconvenienced me considerably.Equally distressing has been the severely lacking communication throughout this ordeal. The emails received fell short of the expected standards, lacking clarity and professionalism, compounding the frustration of an already disappointing experience.Despite the company policy stipulating a prompt resolution within 2-3 working days, my refund is inexplicably delayed. This further exacerbates my dissatisfaction with the handling of my exchange.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED	2023-12-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6582b89070d411b8b8fa4030	-0.01710526315789474	neutral	["house", "dissatisfaction", "company", "quality", "within", "lacking", "writing", "review", "express", "extreme"]

7492	houseofcb	Dan Green	I ordered the Carmen dress in a size S and matched my measurements to those on the website. When it arrived, it didn’t fit as the waist of the dress was 24 inches not the 25.5-28 inches advertised. I contacted House of CB to resolve the issue but was told “The measurements on our website are not the flat measurements of the item, as it depends on the stretch and fabric”. No where on the website or specifically on the Carmen Dress does it specify the sizing may vary to the sizing chart. With this reasoning you’re flat out guessing which size you might be. Despite the dress waist being 1.5 inches smaller than what was advertised, they refused to refund the postage.

7493	houseofcb	Alicia	My experience with this fashion brand was disappointing. Despite spending money, the item's value was not commensurate.

The use of exclamation marks in customer communication was also rude.

One of my orders containing 2 dresses apparently failed on their end, I got a confirmation email. So now one of the dresses is sold out and they wont be re-stocking, so I don't get to wear the dress I paid for and was in stock when I bought it because their website doesn't work properly.Comunication is pretty much non existent with customer service.I've DM them on instagram and everytime someone answers my messages is a different person and they don't know what's going on with my order...they've offered me a refund for the dress but it is to be refunded still. Since the refund offer they've stopped answering my messages. The other order hasn't shipped yes, which is why I sent them an email asking to cancel that order, at this point I don't whant their dresses or anything to do with them. I feel like if you're going to charge a premium for "good quality clothes" your customer service and online shopping experience should match that. To be honest their quality is better than Zara or Mango but not by much, if you claim to be "slow fashion" don't have your clothes made in China.

7496	houseofcb	Lilly Miller	If I could give it 0 stars I would. First and foremost I made my purchase for my birthday under the impression that shipping would be quick. It says 2-3 day shipping on their website, it even gives instructions on when to buy to receive items by the weekend. Well my birthday came and went without receiving the dresses. I eventually had to go pick them up after 9 days. Tried them on and both dresses have manufacturers defects. My Pietra dress straps refused to stay up and the invisible zipper on the Salma dress was sewn incorrectly and will not lay flat. Customer service was awful the entire time, ran around in circles wouldn’t give an apology or offer anything to resolve the issues. Had to threaten a chargeback just for them to offer me $25 to have the dresses altered. For the price point you would think they were handcrafting these dresses, but no, they ship from China. For the price point you’d think they’d be well made. Nope. The fabric and design are good quality but the execution was off: uneven seams, big bump in my zipper, stiff straps, non adjustable, sewn too far apart.. for the price point you’d think you’d get decent customer service.. no they’re as personable and sympathetic as an automated machine.

7507	houseofcb	Paige Paynton	I am disgusted by how I have been treated by this company. I recently reached out and emailed house of cb as I was having trouble ordering an item online. It would not allow me to process my payment. I tried multiple different payment methods but none would work, an ‘error’ message would appear. I communicated this and received a response stating ‘our system is unable to take payments from your account anymore’ which I found extremely unhelpful and vague. I therefore asked for an explanation as to why. I was then told it was due to a past order I had placed, which I had to request a replacement of. The email read “your case was referred after they were to returned to us, and our management has advised we wouldn't be able to accept payments from your account anymore”. The item in reference was placed back in 2019. At the time, I got in touch with the customer service team as shortly after receiving the said item (a pair of heels), they broke; which they shouldn’t have. At the time, the team were efficient and effective in their handling of this- they apologised and sent a replacement. It was never communicated that as a result of this incident my email would be blocked from ever placing another order. I am absolutely appalled by their handling of this and cannot fathom how they deem this to be in any way acceptable. Is this how all replacement orders and customer issues are dealt with? I did nothing wrong. I’m really not happy with how I have been treated as a customer who has purchased many items from this company both online and in stores.

7510	houseofcb	Olga N	Customer service is horrible and the quality is not great. I bought a few items from them and was having some issues with the quality lately. But the last straw was when my order was not delivered when tracking said it was. They asked me for my ID to start an investigation with the delivery company. Absolutely ridiculous. Luckily the delivery company had more sense and found my parcel after I contacted them. They are not honest with their clients and are ignoring the Consumer Right Act. I have now deleted my account with them. Update: Order 6756718, since houseofcb is trying to take the review down. I had to provide Trustpilot all my email correspondence with houseofcb, as they really tried to take the review down.	2023-09-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/65473691a1f40b9586d0d280	-0.11733821733821737	negative	["quality", "order", "delivery", "company", "houseofcb", "take", "review", "customer", "service", "horrible"]
7511	houseofcb	Lisa McCranor	The returns process is awful. For quite an expensive brand, you would think there would be pre-paid returns. Pretty much everywhere covers returns, but not House of CB - disappointing for a “luxury” brand. The packing is awful as well, I had 6 dresses squished into a shoe box. This was almost impossible to fold back up into this tiny space after trying them all on. It was also in a bag the exact same size of the box, so there is no leeway once opened to get it back in the bag and covered entirely. All in all in a disappointing experience.	2023-11-04	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/654663aa99cf8770bb79e8fb	-0.2619047619047619	negative	["returns", "awful", "brand", "would", "disappointing", "box", "back", "bag", "process", "quite"]

7515	houseofcb	Cora Torongo	I purchased the Kara dress in ‘Pink Quartz’ for my senior homecoming dress. It was a very expensive dress, but after a long debate, I decided to go for it since it was my last opportunity to wear a dress like the Kara dress to a school dance. I also thought, “Maybe it is meant to be as my nickname since I was a child is CB” (My initials, Cora Blythe). When it arrived, I knew the dress truly was meant to be. The fit was perfect, and the quality did meet the price point. The fabric was amazing; there were absolutely no design flaws, not even a single stitch! It was everything I had hoped for and more. Apart from my love for the dress, it seemed everyone around me felt the same way. I received endless compliments all night from my friends, family, and even strangers.

Got told to send it back for “inspection” to determine if it was in fact faulty even though i supplied photos showing the faults. They promised to cover my postage costs before sending my item back which i never received and when i mentioned it in an email, they ignored my request to be reimbursed. Then when they agreed my item was faulty they said they’d sent another one out. I said no thank you i’d like a refund after all this palaver, I no longer wished to shop at House of CB but they sent me it out anyway despite the fact i said no.  They then continued to say that it’s not in our policy to refund items that have been worn, when in fact it wasn’t worn, it was merely tried on. What a horrible experience. I can’t believe the hoops I had to jump through to return a faulty item that had never been worn AND I never even got my money back. And now no one is replying to my emails.

7523	houseofcb	CollectPlus Customer	Quality of dresses have seriously gone downhill, yet their mid- high prices have remained the same. Unfortunately, in July, I purchased a dress from this company which I had to return for inspection, due to the inferior quality and unsuitability of it. It lasted approximately 2hrs on my body before it started falling apart at the seams! Literally! Furthermore, the poor standard of boning in the corset caused the dress to bend after I had been sat down, so once stood up, the bodice was sticking out rather unattractively. Since the strap seams were coming apart and the bodice was bent, I decided to change, mid event, into my back up outfit. NOT IDEAL. However my complaint with this company continues as they have since come back to me and offered a brand new IDENTICAL dress… but when I’ve asked if the same issues happen again with the new one, am I able to return for a different dress due to the manufacture issues with this style, I’ve been told no. So of course I no longer want anything to do with the dress, as the same thing will undoubtedly happen again. It’s a quality and manufacturing issue and not a one off. It’s a cheap dress with a mid-high price tag. Every time I try and escalate my concerns to their customer service email, I get the same response back. Will escalate to the ombudsman if I don’t get any further information from the company.	2023-07-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/650b1dc036e7a3c250742020	-0.06466006216006216	neutral	["dress", "quality", "company", "back", "mid", "return", "due", "apart", "seams", "bodice"]

7535	houseofcb	O H	In November 2021, I ordered a dress from this House of CB for my birthday, with the promise of 2-3 day shipping. Unfortunately, it took a staggering 3 weeks to arrive, missing my birthday entirely. The disappointment didn't end there; the dress's cut and fit were so off that I had to double-check if I had ordered the correct item on their website. To make matters worse, they insisted that I cover the return shipping cost. This experience left me vowing never to shop with them again.Fast forward to August 2023, and I stumbled upon a stunning dress from the same brand on TikTok. I decided to give them another chance, especially since they allowed customers to select their cup size when ordering. I opted for the smaller cup size. However, when the dress arrived, it had cups so massive that I could fit my Pomeranian in them. When I contacted their customer service to report this glaring discrepancy, they denied my claim, despite my providing over 10 photos clearly illustrating the issue. Their response was that there was a string between the cups, which was true, but it was purely decorative and had no bearing on the cup size.I requested a return label so I could send back their flawed product, they replied, "We don't provide return labels, but we can refund you for shipping up to $25." Once they received my return, they continued to assert that the dress was not faulty and refused to refund my return shipping cost. It's evident that they intentionally omit providing return labels to shift the cost of their mistakes onto the consumer and then deny any wrongdoing. The gaslighting and unprofessionalism I've encountered during this experience have been nothing short of astonishing.	2023-08-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64f0b64159bab42e48bea6e1	0.024489795918367356	neutral	["return", "dress", "shipping", "cost", "cup", "ordered", "birthday", "fit", "experience", "size"]

7537	houseofcb	SE	Beware this company. Sizing is all over the place - I wear a size 8 and this company's size 8-10 wouldn't even do up. Had to send back - which they do not cover postage fees for which cost £8. Ordered size 12-14 which was again a bizarre size where it fit on the waist and the shoulders were massive. Quality and service is not good enough for price. No refunds offered on sale items - only credit. No reason for this as they take the sale items off sale. This would be fine if their sizing wasnt insane and you lose money every time you send an item back. Company has essentially swallowed my money.EDIT: They provided a full refund after I stated the law to them - so while it's good I have my money back now, it's not a good look is it?	2023-08-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64e77f6cecb68f475a72987d	0.03777777777777778	neutral	["size", "back", "good", "sale", "company", "sizing", "send", "items", "money", "beware"]
7538	houseofcb	Izza Partier	They used to make the best quality, gorgeous dresses. I made an order during their recent sales and the quality is apalling. Sizing is now smaller, bust  area impossibly small you'd have to be completely flat chested to fit and one dress was see-through due to how thin the main fabric and lining are. I commented on their IG my concern that the quality of the dresses drom my recent haul is inferior compared to the dresses ive bought years ago. And they DELETED it. Very sad. It used to be one of my fave brands.Out of the 3 dresses, 1 turned out great. The other 2 will need major alterations.I think they changed their manufacturer. The recent shipping came from my home country Philippines, which wasn't where it was before. It's probably why the quality has changed significantly.They used to be one of my go-to brands but now I think I'll explore other options first.	2023-08-23	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64e4f76668be6199c32aaa15	0.09328703703703706	neutral	["quality", "dresses", "used", "recent", "one", "think", "changed", "make", "best", "gorgeous"]

There are so many occasions I plan on wearing this to… a garden wedding, apple picking, shopping around town. I’m 5’6”, with a 32C bust, 25.5” waist, and 34” hips and the XS Regular (A-C cups) fit me perfectly. The sizing chart was accurate, and the dress fits true to size. I’m so happy I got this dress, and I’ll definitely be getting another!	2023-08-14	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64dcde6cfd06e45409be94f3	0.35714285714285715	positive	["dress", "one", "fit", "skeptical", "house", "dresses", "wanting", "cottage", "collection", "finally"]
7544	houseofcb	Theya Snowdon	I purchased the pixie dress in flame orange for a wedding. It didn’t arrive on the day stated by fedex but 3 days later. As it was an expensive item I was quite frustrated by this. Then, when I tried on the dress it was COMPLETELY see through. On the website it also claimed to have supportive cups but does not and the straps were so long there was no way it was going to support my chest. Overall really disappointed as I have always admired the brand just don’t think the quality of clothes I received is worth the price point.	2023-08-14	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64da1e9a818b90f4c59dc84c	-0.1222222222222222	negative	["dress", "purchased", "pixie", "flame", "orange", "wedding", "arrive", "day", "stated", "fedex"]

7546	houseofcb	Pauline Delaney	I have been a loyal customer of this company for more than 8 years and am extremely disappointed with their ridiculous sizing.  I have been wearing size XS in dresses but in the last 2 years or so I now cannot fit into a XS dress due to it being too tight across the hips, waist and back.  I ordered a size S in a dress which was too big on the waist and hips. Today a XS in the same style dress arrived and I cannot even get it over my head.  I have not changed my size in the last 5 years so why have they?  I think they must custom size the dresses worn by the models otherwise even they would not be able to fit into the items I have received.  Customer service is non-existent as I have never received a response to any e-mails I have sent. Shame on you guys.	2023-08-10	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64d4e0c4ea2f99a56f511432	0.053316326530612246	neutral	["size", "years", "dress", "customer", "dresses", "last", "fit", "hips", "waist", "even"]

The return/exchange process was super easy to follow and the company is really responsive via email. I was able to get my dressed exchanged right in time for my trip.

7551	houseofcb	Cordelia	Congratulations House of CB! You guys win big when it comes to zero customer service, unreliable sizing and cheap quality! Never mind that the dress I ordered for an event didn't fit me, despite the fact that I am even slightly below the measurements they provided on their size chart. Never mind I had to pay for my own return shipping when plenty of online stores provide free returns these days and never mind that there is no clear guide on returns on their website or an easy portal / email to contact the company about returns. After quite a bit of hounding a staff member on their facebook, I received some instructions on returns and followed it accordingly. Seemed simple enough, the returns centre is even just a 45 mins flight away from where I live. Well, nope! For some reason, House of CB has chosen the worst location to have a returns centre, Kuala Lumpur... one might wonder if it's done on purpose so that 'lost' packages in Malaysian customs [My post office informed me it has a bad reputation] can never be found, and since House of CB is unlikely to receive it, they immediately reduce the number of returns and refunds they'll need to process. What a nightmare! Zero updates despite emails asking for an update, and this is only my very first time ordering from the store. Well, congratulations House of CB, take my money and run! And then there's the audacity to send me a measly 10% off code to sweeten the deal while I wait for my returns to be processed. What a joke! I think I can forget about getting anything back and I hope this cautionary tale helps some people out there. Girls, go shop somewhere that actually shows some semblance of a proper system in place, House of CB isn't worth it.	2023-07-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64c0d739f0c2090aa8ff1693	0.03454717630853998	neutral	["returns", "house", "never", "mind", "congratulations", "zero", "despite", "even", "centre", "well"]
7552	houseofcb	Isabelle Ruokolainen	Everything went well. I ordered my dress from House of cb , London 12.07.2023 and it arrived today 25.7.2023. Shipping time was Full 9 work days, which is nice. I thought it would have taken longer because I live in north europe. I'm happy that it managed to arrive before August because I'm invited to big party to Zákynthos and the weather is pretty hot, so is great to have a dress which is not so uncomfy. Dress fits perfectly, and its light/comfy. I have B-cup so I was sceptical at first if it will fit me correctly but it really did. I was scared that the boob area would be too big. Shipping taxes to Finland were kind of pricy but its ok because now I have dress for a lifetime.	2023-07-25	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64c010c79c5686576b2b53bf	0.4090909090909091	positive	["dress", "shipping", "would", "big", "everything", "went", "well", "ordered", "house", "london"]

7553	houseofcb	Consumer	I paid extra for next day delivery as I was leaving early in the morning the day after. I ordered my product shortly after 12 on a Thursday with next day delivery and have received several messages on Friday morning that my parcel is coming between 10:29 and 11:29 am. Hours after my package should have arrived I contacted the delivery service who informed me that my package will be coming in an hour. Needless to say it has never arrived and when I gave them a call the following morning they told me it won’t be delivered until Monday and they will also not hand it to me at the depot they sent it back to. I paid a premium for this product and the next day delivery, only to not be delivered on the day intended but not even the day after. When contacted, Parcelforce’s customer service was rude and misleading, while House of CB seemed unreachable and clearly unreliable with the information they state on their website. I have asked for a full refund and won’t be purchasing from them ever again.	2023-07-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64bb8dafb2d2c7cc04babdb8	-0.017857142857142856	neutral	["day", "delivery", "next", "morning", "paid", "product", "coming", "package", "arrived", "contacted"]

I wanted to buy dresses for a summer of 3 wedding, ordered worth 1200€ of dresses, influenced by the nice photos on the website but I didn’t know spending money in this shop was worse than applying for a Japanese visa. The customer service asked for ID, photo of the Debit Card (who does that?) and your bank statements. They take so long to answer and don’t really seem to care about logic.They asked even more useless proofs and I am seriously worries about the security of the document I already sent.The fees for shipping in Europe are atrocious + all this fuss for overly expensive dresses that don’t reflect in the quality of the fabric.

7555	houseofcb	Lauren	What the hell is up with their sizing?? I desperately needed a top for a wedding and bought a size up thinking at least I will be able to get in and would rather have it too loose. I am usually an 6-8 in UK sizing and bought a small which they say is 8-10. I couldn't even put it on, my arm literally wouldn't fit through the hole. I tried it on my 8 year old for a giggle and it just about fit her arm! House of CB sort it out what an absolute waste of time and energy. Where the hell are you making these clothes and getting your measurements from?? I would exchange for a size up but the measurements are so laughable I'd have no faith in any of the other sizes either. Seem to be unable to reave reviews on their website.

7563	houseofcb	Andrea Baerga	Recently ordered the Tatiana dress in black and it did fit true to size for me, is absolutely gorgeous and arrived fast. However, I put it on to wear it out for the first time today and one of the buttons already fell off. ): plus I can tell some other buttons were also sewn loose so they might fall off later on as well. I thought it’d be better quality & that at least some extra buttons would be included with the dress given the price. This type of situation doesn’t warrant a return but they should take these possibilities into consideration and at least the very least include extra buttons with these dresses.Edit 7/12/23: As seen below, the House of Cb team did respond to my claim and after giving them additional information through email they did send extra buttons in for free & I received them already. Still, I think these should already be included with the dress.	2023-06-30	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64a0674edc39b89201626498	0.08007834757834756	neutral	["buttons", "dress", "already", "least", "extra", "included", "recently", "ordered", "tatiana", "black"]

I don’t know if your management team has brain to set return place in China which a place applies highest import tax over the world.  I have to spend £9 for delivery which I understand.  But around £30 import tax, excuse me? Since when an international enterprise that import tax should be paid by customers? Also, I have returned within 28 days and the staff in China has reject my package. Now, I have no idea what gonna happen to next. No wonder why TaoBao has so many house of cb dress marked has same factory and within 25% of the price. They even can offer free return.

After contacting the customer service, they told me it was already delivered even if I gave them proof of my choice to postpone delivery (since I live in a big building and I knew it could be stolen). The process was neverending and unsuccessful. I eventually got tired of sending proofs and gave up on getting my items or money back. I think this is what they want us to do.I have already order before, nice designs but not amazing quality for the price and I feel like they really don't care if they are giving an awful service as long as they take our money.I highly recommend people not buying from them.

7571	houseofcb	Vivi Mizu	The dress is really lovely and it arrived within 3 days of ordering. However, it did NOT match the size guide provided online.I usually have great confidence in ordering online because I know my exact measurements. Every time I order something it comes in fitting like a glove. Now… I ordered a medium dress which is supposed to fit a 36” bust and 28-30” waist according to provided size guide. Those are my EXACT measurements and I know I’m an Australian 8-10 based off of what I’ve purchased in the past. It did not zip up! I could barely fit into the dress and I felt like I was going insane. Did I suddenly gain a bunch of weight? I double checked my own measurements. 36” bust, 29” waist. It is supposed to fit! I laid down the dress on a flat surface and started taking the measurements myself. Lo and behold… The waist sat at 25-26” and bust at 30-32”. The dress was still labelled as a medium. I wish I could add photos to this review because I took so many photos showing evidence of wrong sizing. I really hope this will get sorted out… This dress is for my brother’s wedding and I don’t have a lot of time left. Driving me nuts!—————————Update/Reply: The response I received through customer support was not very helpful. There was no mention of whether or not the shipping was covered for the defective item, nor did they have any explanation as to why the dress had incorrect sizing. Was the dress mislabelled or is the size guide wrong? I need a clear answer, otherwise I’m hesitant to do the exchange in the case that the size guide is wrong and I may receive another ill-fitting item. I sent a follow up email mentioning these concerns. I hope I receive a reply soon, before I have it dropped off to the post office.	2023-06-18	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6493a1ecf438471004051c8c	0.0662777777777778	neutral	["dress", "size", "guide", "measurements", "fit", "bust", "waist", "wrong", "really", "ordering"]

I had UPS tracking info and was able to follow my package throughout its transit.I had no issues with the packaging of my dress; it came by default in a beautiful box with a cute pink ribbon. This type of thing doesn’t make a huge difference for me personally, but I’m mentioning it because I’m surprised by other reviews that say otherwise.And for the dress itself, I know this is going to sound intense but I am OVER THE MOON with its quality and fit. The sizing guidelines are great and were essential to my purchase, I’m glad I double checked them; sizing in the UK can be different, so I would strongly advise following them to a T. This dress is exactly as advertised and will require no alterations. Overall, this experience exceeded each and every one of my expectations. I will definitely be shopping with them again.	2023-05-28	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6474fc0f82d3805c1b68f3a3	0.259469696969697	neutral	["dress", "sizing", "received", "scheduled", "date", "nice", "surprise", "ups", "tracking", "info"]

7579	houseofcb	Louisa Braastad	Horrible customer service. Received a dress with a lot of loose threads (that couldn't be removed by just pulling on them) and the corset was sewn crooked on one side, I couldn't get the creasing out even if I pulled it taut. I sent an E-Mail and they told me to send it back (mind you, 10€ that I had to pay by myself) for them to inspect it. Their warehouse received the garment and didn't write back for two weeks until I messaged them again. They told me they couldn't find any faults in the item and that the threads were just little pieces of thread caught in the seam and that the dress was sewn right but just didn't fit me. They won't give me my money back as it was a sale item and will only exchange for a gift card or another item of clothing. They advertise their dresses for being high quality but then won't take a dress back that clearly does not live up to what they promise. Avoid this company at all costs.Order number: 6225129Edit: But this is exactly the problem I have, your thorough inspection did not find the faults that I clearly documented with pictures. You just pretend they don't exist. I already returned the dress (which is not on sale on the site anymore by the way) if there are no faults in the item, as you pretend there are none, why don't you just resell it and give me my money back? It's because you know your dresses are not the quality you promise and you can't resell a faulty dress.

7582	houseofcb	Marina Kochur	i’ve recently made an order (#6341763) for a skirt that was a part of a set. the delivery time stated to be longer than usual but still up to 6 days. when the order wasn’t shipped out after 4 working days i decided to reach out and double check. they reassured me that they were experiencing a big amount of orders and recommended me to wait a bit longer. after 8 working days since the order was placed it still hadn’t been shipped out and i had to reach out to them once again only to find out that they did not have this item in stock anymore. gladly in my case customer support was quite reactive and refunded me the money (hopefully it won’t take too long to get get back to my bank account) but still it was surprising to me that after almost 2 weeks of waiting it total they didn’t inform me about the issue and i had to reach out to them myself. very upsetting, no discounts offered for the inconvenience, i was expecting the item for a special occasion and got very disappointed with how the things turned out. but after reading the feedbacks about the sizing, quality and expensive returns i’m glad i didn’t spend over 300€ for the whole set on their website.	2023-05-18	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64661309ae9035db9a4c7779	0.04263392857142856	neutral	["order", "still", "days", "reach", "set", "longer", "shipped", "working", "item", "get"]
7583	houseofcb	Vicky K.	The short version: gorgeous dresses, exactly as in the photos, perfect quality, perfect fitting, super fast delivery. Saving money to buy my next dress.The long version: This was my first time ordering from house of CB and I was kind of aware due to the ratings here. I also was aware about the size, since there are comments saying that clothes from house of CB run small. So I first ordered the Sabrina dress in M (even though I am size small according to their chart), which, of course, I had to moderate a bit. Then I ordered the Carmen dress in S, which fits perfect. The quality of both dresses is great. The Sabrina dress is relatively heavy. The Carmen dress has this perfect corset, which you can tighten up to make your waist look smaller, or not if you want a more loose fit. In any case it is very comfortable. Definitely there is no comparison with fast fashion clothes.The shipping to Greece was super fast. I placed both orders late at night and within 12-18 hours both dresses have already been dispatched. Since you already pay the taxes when placing the order there was no delay there (kudos to ups and the Greek employers at the customs office as well?). It took 5 working days for each dress to arrive.I am 1,63 cm and my measurements are approximately 89-69-89. Size S was perfect for me.	2023-05-12	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/646355d0f0284bd740a838dc	0.27457621082621075	neutral	["perfect", "dress", "dresses", "fast", "size", "version", "quality", "super", "first", "house"]

7588	houseofcb	riley	The dress I ordered was beautiful in cut, the fabric was nice and it was true to size, unfortunately for $225, I expect my dress to not be see through. The dress is composed of only two layers of chiffon, with no lining as is customary with this fabric. Underwear is completely visible, I now have to purchase new undergarments for the wedding I ordered it for in hopes to minimize noticeability, as I do not have time to return it. I would have been happy to pay this price for such a beautiful dress, but this is a large error in dress making and selling.

It’s not acceptable sizing and it has actually annoyed me. I don’t understand it. I didn’t care for me, I would have worn the large had there been a nice dress but like does it just not cater for plus size then ? Not that more than a size 10 is even plus size lol The woman in the shop didn’t offer me any help and was too busy running back and forth for another customer to the point where I just left.

I have been ordering online from them for several months and have always received exceptional customer service when I asked them for help over email. When I decided to visit their physical store in Stratford to try on dresses for my engagement party, the staff there went above and beyond to make me feel welcome.The ladies working there were incredibly friendly and patient as I tried on over 20 dresses in various sizes. They were attentive and even offered suggestions on sizing to help me find the perfect fit. I have never had such a positive shopping experience, especially as someone who doesn't fit into the typical size 0.The store had a great selection of designs and sizes, and they even offered me heels to try on with the dresses. Although I don't remember the names of the specific employees who helped me, every person I interacted with was wonderful.Overall, I highly recommend House of CB and I will definitely be returning for future shopping trips.	2023-04-20	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6443fa822b90832867981c1f	0.23153679653679654	neutral	["shopping", "dresses", "experience", "house", "help", "store", "try", "sizes", "even", "offered"]

My most recent purchase i went for the 3 for £150 sale, and I'm sooooooo glad I didn't pay full price for these dresses. In fact they are not even worth 50pounds. The material feels low quality and the construction on one of them in particular was what you'd expect from a fast fashion sweat shop...I am disappointed to say the least. It's sad that they have all these gorgeous photos on the site, giving the impression that their price tags are because of high end products.But It's like russian roulette. Do not be fooled.

7598	houseofcb	Alex	I was hesitant to buy from their online store after reading the reviews here, but unfortunately after looking at what felt like thousand of dresses for a friend's wedding, they had the only dress I liked that also wasn't $400+. I will say that their items run small so if you can order from Nordstrom where exchanges/returns do not have to cost you, DO THIS INSTEAD. That way you don't have to pay the return shipping. In my case the item I wanted, Nordstrom did not carry it. My dress definitely was not breathable so I had to return for a bigger size. I never return things and pay but I had to make an exception for this occasion. Their return policy states that it takes 2-3 working days but I emailed on the 3rd day to ask customer service and they were so communicative, helpful, transparent, and quickly responded! My suggestion is perhaps having more locations to return items or to have more options available with Nordstrom. As well, could also make the return shipping fee a credit for future purchases.	2023-04-07	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/64404af0bf2e190434d07716	0.13888888888888887	neutral	["return", "nordstrom", "dress", "also", "items", "pay", "shipping", "make", "hesitant", "buy"]

No drycleaners will clean it re the diamante.No compensation so can’t wear it as needs cleaning.Couldn’t wear it over Christmas re broken diamante.Companies emails were very robotic in answers & smiley faces at the end which were not professional.Didn’t give answers to the problems given.Just kept giving a link to the company policy regarding returns as had been worn!

I am a size 6/XS everywhere, but when the dress arrived it was closer to a size 0 - I couldn’t even wrap the dress over most of my ribs. The material felt like a costume and what’s worse, to return it I had to pay £12 to send it tracked because they don’t cover returns and request it has to be tracked. And there’s no way to mark a return so I have to send it and hope for the best I get a refund of a £160 dress that was no where near close to fitting. Basically just paid £12 not to have a dress… Incredibly disappointed especially given they are expensive dresses and I’d been wanting one for years. Also their website is not user friendly, you create and account and it doesn’t show any order history just your details.

I was looking to buy several dresses so the exchange rate fee would've been HUGE. I suggested they provide a discount code or voucher card to cover this as I'd be paying it because of THEIR oversight and this attempted solution was completely ignored.Service is 0/10, didn't even try to help or solve my problem at all.

I tried on several of your dresses (most of which, I loved) and ended up getting the perfect dress with no need for any alterations (perfect fit).  Received several compliments on the dress!

7620	houseofcb	Nat	First time ordering from House of CB and I’ve never been so pleased! I was hesitant to do so based on higher cost, location (as I am Canada based), and sizing (models look very curvy, and at 6’2 / 150lbs I am not very curvy). I was looking for one dress to wear to an event, and ended up having to keep two because the fit and quality could not have been better! The process from order to arrival was very quick and the packaging was adorable (box, ribbon, tissue paper, etc.). I had ordered from Reformation previously for a similar style dress to the Charlotte, but House of CB wins with the thicker fabric, more structure and flattering pattern. Ordered: Jaida (Toast Corset Maxi Dress) - MediumCharlotte (Peony Print Midi Sundress) -Med. (A-C cup)Carmen (Peony Print Bustier Sundress) -Med. (A-C cup)*Only returned the Carmen as the Charlotte is the same pattern and I picked a favourite. In the process of a return, but instructions came with the package and I provided tracking to their customer service who responded very quickly.	2023-02-17	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63eff3849b64b1bdaf5ae018	0.2833333333333333	neutral	["dress", "house", "based", "curvy", "process", "ordered", "charlotte", "pattern", "peony", "print"]

7626	houseofcb	Danielle	Next delivery is actually 3 days after and cost to return postage minimum £9!!!!

As it came too late I went to the post office to return it just to find out it would be minimum of £9 to return for something that wasn’t my fault.Apparently, For a weekend or Monday delivery you have to order by 4:30pm Friday with next day delivery. Be careful as This is not stated when selecting delivery options - only when you click delivery and returns info in the small text at the bottom of the webpage. When contacted by their customer service team, they are very careful at playing on words - as long as the item came next day to them dispatching (they dispatch 2 days after order) you are not eligible for a delivery refund. Free delivery comes 4 days so you will be better doing such; next day is really 3 days after!Needless to say I will not be shopping with this company again. If you really want an item, go to selfridges instead.

The pants were unimaginably huge despite of me following their measurement guidelines. I looked like I was placed in a cargo bag with those pants I ordered. Their customer service is horrible. Despite of them responding, they don't really resolve any issues nor cannot give you any assurance if you'll ever get your money back despite of them receiving the items in perfect and original packaging.

In the years I've been shopping with them I've never had (touch wood) any issues with returns or customer service. (I've probably purchased over 10 items?) What surprises me even more is the complaints RE quality? I can hand on heart honestly say the quality is second to none.I've even had a dress shipped to me earlier than the release date for my birthday. I'm no ambassador for the company or an influencer, just your average shopper. My last order was the Forest Green Corset Dress, I ordered on 19/12/22 late evening and delivery was AM of 21/12/22. The fit was perfect, the quality of the fabric was spot on and the packaging was beautiful.I'm sad to learn of others negative experiences as for me personally, House of CB are the first company I will ever shop with should I have an occasion.	2022-12-19	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63c804a24d0773066a3bdfc3	0.06875	neutral	["ive", "quality", "negative", "house", "even", "dress", "company", "wish", "negate", "anyone"]

I work in an office and throughout the day the sleeve separated… really embarrassing and annoying considering the cost of House of CB items. I contacted the online team and send photos, explained what had happened. They said they could not pursue the matter unless I returned the item - at my own cost.I did post the cardigan back to them, I had to contact them for an update days after they had accepted the item. I have been informed that House of CB do not refund items that have been worn - regardless whether faulty or not. They offered an exchange but would not refund me for the item. I am now stuck - having not received a refund or replacement, have not been reimbursed for the return costs. And have been told they do not refund faulty items… I have had many successful purchases from this brand. Their clothes are expensive but usually worth it. I would not purchase any item from them again in the future. I have never known customer services to be so appalling, especially for a higher-end retailer. Would totally avoid - they are breaching consumer rights by not refunding items they admit are faulty.	2022-12-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63ad911a4d0773066a283f28	0.06153846153846155	neutral	["faulty", "item", "refund", "items", "would", "cardigan", "online", "sleeve", "house", "scam"]
7646	houseofcb	Mykala Destecroix	The outfits have nice material but the shape in how they are made don't really sit right. The sizing is small to size so best to size up. I've also been to the store in London I find the staff quite rude. If you order online and you want to return an item you have to pay for it to be returned and they want it tracked and signed for so cost me £8.95 with post office. They don't accept PayPal so you have no protection. And I find the items very over priced. I think house of cb as a company would benefit more by having free next day delivery service for a year or at least free returns as it puts people off ordering again with the worry it might cost them to return.

7655	houseofcb	Rachel	The dress (Adriana black dress) arrived all okay with pretty presentation. It fitted when I tried it on, and the material was thick. However, it looked different to the model. The dress on the model has completely different shaped straps, and the lace bit of the dress doesn’t connect with the straps (luring you into thinking it is high quality lace which can stand by itself.) However, the bra section of this dress was stitched poorly and unevenly on the lining and the lace on each breast was uneven, creating a cheap and unflattering neckline. The alignment was also unsymmetrical. So I decided to send it back. I received no confirmation email of an accepted refund in the ‘2-3 business days’ window. So I completed their ‘chasing a return’ email/form which is a ‘24 hour’ response window. Still heard nothing from the company. Ordered on 18/11/22. Delivered 21/11/22. Confirmation of my return (which I had to pay for) on 24/11/22. It is now 30/11/22 and I have had no reply. Very unprofessional and useless customer care. Spent £159 on this dress in the hopes it would be a NYE dress but instead left incredibly out of pocket. Wouldn’t buy again.	2022-11-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6386c44f252cba2c02e81fa8	0.03196078431372549	neutral	["dress", "lace", "however", "different", "model", "straps", "confirmation", "window", "return", "adriana"]
7648	houseofcb	Amabel Loh	Spent close to 1k on their site and even asked which size to get for the corset top because some of their clothes run really really small and they recommended me a size XS. So I bought the clothes in XS and none of them fit. Absolutely ridiculous because I have a smaller chest than their models and they claim their models are wearing an XS too. I am 49kg almost 170cm and I can't even zip their XS past my chest so idk what fits their XS - a kid. So anyway first thing first, recommendation and sizing on web COMPLETELY OFF AND UNTRUE. Secondly, one of my bodysuits came snagged so the sewing came off and I sent them pictures and they said they can't see it properly so I should send them photos of me wearing it. I send them a half naked video of myself explaining the flap should be sewn and added more pictures showing a clear snag and they told me to send the item back so that they can 'review' if it's broken essentially telling me that there is a chance that even if I send it back they might deem it in alright condition and send me back the same item,  putting me through all the trouble to send it back. And when I told them about how they recommended me the wrong sizing they just gave me the standard reply of some of the fits run small ....WHICH I ALREADY SAID THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR RECOM.CUSTOMER SERVICE AT IT'S WORST AND THEY WILL ASK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER NUMBER ETC JUST TO TROUBLE YOU AND DO NOTHING BOUT IT. But then again bet they don't care cause I'm the clown in this situation and the only person laughing to the bank is the owner of house of cb taking my money unethically because their clothes expensive af and quality and customer service lousy af.	2022-12-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/639367c70b7fc02715d9d8a6	-0.0796875	neutral	["send", "back", "even", "clothes", "asked", "size", "run", "really", "small", "recommended"]
7649	houseofcb	Emily	The sizing is way off. According to their measurements on the website, I should be a size small, but the medium was very tight and I would never be able to fit in the small. When the medium came, the stitching was so poor and fabric was sticking out in weird places. Such a poorly made dress for over €200. I couldn’t wear it out because of how bad quality it is. You could get so much better for the money you payed elsewhere.	2022-12-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63910a675873c1cf9fce97f2	-0.12110389610389607	negative	["small", "medium", "sizing", "way", "according", "measurements", "website", "size", "tight", "would"]
7650	houseofcb	Katie Bowman	Fault Repair ID: 8DDKLV - Can I give a 0 star please!!!! …….. Went to the Liverpool store 3 years ago, staff were lovely and really helpful, couldn't do enough for me (that was an obvious giving they were in for the sale of a dress), wore the dress ONCE and the stitching came away and literally everything I made contact with was full of glitter where it had transferred off the dress 🤨….. email after email I was eventually advised to take the dress back the shop…. Took it back and was basically made to feel like a fraudster who’d deliberately sabotaged the dress just to get a refund, all whispering in the back discussing whatever and left me on the shop floor for what felt like 3 days 🙄 ….. took the dress off me then weeks later emailed me to say it had been “repaired”!! A) why would I want a faulty repaired dress back, and B) I was never given the option of what I wanted! Got absolutely nowhere with them and the dress is STILL in the box it came back in 3 years later!!! Absolutely disgusting customer service post sale!

Had a SALE item in my cart that I had to think about, because even at sale price the ticket was outrageous and I wasn't sold. Came back the next day to them having removed all sales from their site. No discount codes, absolutely nothing in place to make their prices more acceptable and from other reviews it sounds like their clothes don't fit correctly anyway. You can tell they would try to justify what they charge until they're blue in the face, these clothes could be spun from plated gold and wouldn't be worth the price.

7654	houseofcb	Customer Customers	I went to the Stratford store to try the Selena dress. I saw a few sizes on the rack including many Extra Small sizes and I decided to pick a size Small.  So I picked up the dress and stood in line at the changing room to try it. I tried the dress on and it was too big so I asked one of the many store assistants to please get me an Extra Small. She took about 15 to 20 minutes while I just stood there in the changing room waiting for her to come back. She finally returned and informed me that there were no Extra Small Selena dresses. I didn't even bother arguing with her because I knew for a fact that there were many Extra Small Selena dresses in the store because I had literally just seen them on the rack a few minutes ago when I walked in. I wonder what she was doing for those 15 to 20 minutes that she made me wait in the changing room. Chatting maybe! So I just got dressed and walked away. Before I left the store just to make sure I was right, I checked the rack and saw several Selena dresses in Extra Small!! What is the use of having many store assistants who seem to be just hovering around the store for nothing when they cannot even bring you another dress size while you are trying on dresses? Another issue is the dresses have gone down in quality. I suppose it's the mass production!

Only for them to say it's been shipped from overseas and had not even arrived at their warehouse yet! It was eventually delivered on the 10th business day. I was offered a refund and to cancel the order, which was quickly redacted and now it has been delivered late and they are making me pay for a return, despite already offering to cancel this!

7656	houseofcb	Ciara Sheehy	I ordered a dress which then arrived - fit me perfectly, looked great etc. (I tried it on and wore it round the house for around 15 mins to make sure it was comfortable) I then wore it to my event and it ripped in not 1 but 5 places after less than half an hour and completely ruined my evening. I'm a true to size 8 and have always worn a small in house of CB clothes, I have noticed a serious decline in their quality over the last year or so despite their prices going up.Upon inspection after removing this I could see that the stitching was absolutely awful - I've had £20 dresses that are better quality and this dress cost over £150! I complained via email, sent images and they requested I send the dress back at my own expense which I did. They then sent me an exact replacement despite me informing them this model was clearly bad quality and I no longer needed it as I had worn it to the event, I'm not unreasonable and could understand them not being able to offer me a full refund but to not offer an exchange for a different model of dress or store credit is ridiculous? Surely the fact they sent me a replacement is effectively them admitting the fault is with them. I was offered no explanation to why I couldn't have a different model - absolute waste of time the customer service team just send you round in circles. Don't buy from House of CB anymore, quality is terrible now and the service is even worse.	2022-11-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/63862e1fb84cc27618fac84c	0.06015625000000001	neutral	["dress", "quality", "house", "sent", "model", "wore", "round", "event", "worn", "despite"]

Simply unacceptable for me such a terrible customer service. So much time has past, Did they even bother to send it to the correct adress? Now they behave like it is customer’s fault and only the customer should solve his own problem. They took the money and don’t care about the rest. Also, They ask a lot of personal documents and utility bill for the address, what the dress has to do with an utility bill? It makes absolutely no sense. They should be shut down for such a behavior towards customers. Also, this time it was my second order and First one I received it everything was ok, but now they needed additional documents to proof the same address I oredered first time? Nonsense. They just tried to avoid the refund. But it is their fault that the order didn’t arrive in time! It’s been too long, 4 months this unacceptable!

7671	houseofcb	Funkycoldmedina	I’d been wanting to order from house of cb for ages as their clothing always looks amazing online, but I’ve never had that kind of money until now. I finally saved up and ordered a dress (they don’t use Klarna or clear pay so you need the money up front). As soon as it arrived, I unpackaged it and noticed some stains on the front of the dress. One being quite a large looking water stain. I instantly contacted them and they replied very quickly asking for me to return it by their postage preference. They asked me to send proof of postage and said I will be refunded the return postage cost if they find an issue. I provided photos and it was clear there was staining on the dress so felt assured I would receive a refund. 2 days after I returned it, I received an email saying they’ve refunded me for the cost of the dress but nothing for the postage. For a company who was fast at replies, all of a sudden I was being ignored. I finally received a response days later after sending an angry email and they said they can’t see any manufacturing faults so therefore they will not cover the return cost. I was completely shocked! I was sent out a dress which was damaged and then the company refused to admit they were at fault? How embarrassing for them. What’s worrying is they’ll do it again to someone else. The dress is clearly damaged, but they’ll most likely sell it to someone else and hope they won’t notice. The dress was £160 and for that price I expected so much more. I have now realised they are just another company selling shoddy products with horrendous quality control and customer service. The only difference is, they have massively inflated their prices. This gives off an appearance that they’re different to other brands where a dress will cost no more than £30. Don’t do what I did and be fooled by their website! They just market themselves very well. Unfortunately now I have come onto here I can see they pull this trick very often. I would definitely avoid House of CB and spend the money on something from a small independent designer. Otherwise just find a dupe on another website as you’ll receive the same quality at a fraction of the price	2022-10-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/635f9044252cba2c02ca9a4f	0.024534970238095248	neutral	["dress", "postage", "cost", "money", "return", "company", "house", "finally", "clear", "front"]

I bought a dress on their website  for a wedding and it was ridiculously sized, too big in some parts, too small in others, even though I followed the size chart and looking at the models sizing. I didn’t have enough time to find another dress to wear for the wedding, so I hesitantly kept it and took it to a tailor to have it fitted. Yes that’s right, a £150+ dress taken to the tailor?! When the tailor looked at my dress, the first thing he asked was ‘where is this dress from? The quality is not very good.’ Please do not waste your money here, and go somewhere else.

7675	houseofcb	DDW	I brought a dress from house of cb. When I tried it on the dress fit fine. I took it to my dry cleaners as its dry clean only. When I got it back from my dry cleaners the dress had shrunk. The dry cleaners followed all the instructions on the label. I reached out to house of cb and lodged a complaint on or around 12 September. I was asked to send pictured get a letter from the dry cleaners to which I have complied. It's now 7th October and I'm still waiting to hear from house of cb. According to them the decision is with management.  Iam left with no outfit for a wedding next week,  a dress I have never worn and £179 out of pocket. I will now take steps to lodge a complaint with the ombudsman.I have always been a fan of house of cb and brought many dresses from them with no problems which is why to see the way I have been handled by customer services is diabolical. They are happy to take your money but are not cooperative when problems arise.It seems to me that the quality of the dresses since they first started out has dropped drastically.Update: This is still "with management". They now have the dress back in their possession as they want to inspect it and asked me to send it back. Still no refund! I've asked for a copy of their complaints procedure and this has not been provided. An email was also sent yesterday to "management" requesting the same. No reply as yet. They now reply after chasing again stating they will send me a new dress to which I've made clear I do not want. They ignore me and send the dress via express delivery to which I will be returning back to them! After shopping with HouseofCB since the brand started  I will never shop with them again and I wouldn't advise anyone else to either as if there are problems you will never get your money back, they will try everything in their power to keep your money!	2022-08-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6340a7b9350baeeabe640024	0.08484848484848485	neutral	["dress", "dry", "back", "house", "cleaners", "send", "asked", "still", "management", "never"]

7676	houseofcb	Mayke	Okay, but not worth it unless you fit in their exact sizes.I ordered multiple items from here and they all arrived quickly and in nice packaging, but I've found the sizing is very rigid.According to the size chart my chest is an XXS, my waist is and S and my hips are an XS.The items in XS were too small in the waist and the size S dresses were far too big in the chest. Because of the boning in the tops, there is no way you can wear them if you don't have the right waist to chest ratio. If your waist is too big, you can't zip them up, if your chest is too small there will be a large open space in front of your chest that won't close.None of the clothes from this brand fit me, so I paid for the return shipping. The quality of the items is definitely worth the money, but for at least 100 pounds per dress, I expect them to fit well. I did get my refund reasonably quickly though.	2022-03-17	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/634025eab67840c2ab2adedd	0.16031746031746033	neutral	["chest", "waist", "fit", "items", "worth", "quickly", "size", "small", "big", "okay"]
7677	houseofcb	customer	I ordered from this company an outfit for my birthday as a treat to myself. The item arrived and was nothing like the photo, completely different colour and a huge fit which definitely doesn’t match up the the regular sizing of a 10 (it was more like a 14) and on further inspection also had a black mark on the front of the trousers that although small would of been very noticeable. I contacted the retailer and was told they don’t supply return labels but if I returned they would reimburse my postage of up to £10. Which I happily did. I then had to chase up this and was then told “sorry on this occasion we will not be refunding the return postage” so as an unhappy customer that was sent a defected item I’m now £9 down through not fault of my own and feel scammed by the most unprofessional of retailers I’ve come across. I will not shop with them again and urge everyone else not to waste their time either. The clothes are overpriced and bad quality.

7678	houseofcb	Dena Rendall	Average at best. Prices are ridiculous given the poor quality, sizing is always WAY off. I have never bought anything and kept it, always end up sending back. Probably won't bother again, unfortunately. Real shame because the stuff looks beautiful on the model, but doesn't fit the same and quality is always poorer than is shown.	2022-10-05	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/633d6ff13d107cfdfcd385a5	0.17407407407407405	neutral	["always", "quality", "average", "best", "prices", "ridiculous", "given", "poor", "sizing", "way"]
7679	houseofcb	Tia Williams	Absolute joke. I bought one of the chenille cardigans and after 3 wears it came apart. I contacted house of cb because my item was faulty, after having to pay to return it and wait for them to decide whether it was faulty or not they told me I cannot have a refund but I can have a replacement. I think this is out of order! I ordered something that was faulty and I’m not allowed my money back? When I know I’m well within my rights for a refund. If it happens again am I expected to just keep getting replacements. I won’t be buying from here again because that really doesn’t make sense.	2022-09-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/633c025a4a5fff53cad5e999	0.0875	neutral	["faulty", "refund", "absolute", "joke", "bought", "one", "chenille", "cardigans", "wears", "came"]
7680	houseofcb	NC	I ordered 2 sizes of a dress for my wedding reception and neither of them fit so returned both dresses.  It was the same dress but in 2 sizes so they shipped it in one package and i returned both in the same packaging.They only refunded me for one dress. I have my receipt which clearly shows the weight of the item returned ( their dresses are heavy so it’s clear more than one dress was sent back from the weight of the item and obviously they should have a record of the weight of the item they sent). I contacted them on email and fb messenger whilst abroad for my wedding may I add… takes absolutely ages (48 hrs plus) to get any response… then all they come back with is … “ can you confirm the returns were sent together “ ( when this was clearly stated in the email I sent them) and then “ we will look into it”. Up to now I’m still waiting to hear back. They told me stupid ridiculous things like oh if it’s 2 orders then the refunds will take different times .. so they clearly didn’t read my email stating I ordered 2 sizes of the same dress and returned them both together. In any case they only sent out one shipment so if anyone should know that it was one order with 2 dresses it should be them yet I had to wait like 48 hours just to get that back as a response??? Im here abroad trying to enjoy what should be a celebration yet trying to message them every time I get wifi… I will NEVER order from them again after this. They charge £179 for a dress then won’t refund me the money??? From a company that sells clothes that cost so much their customer service should be better. I’m so annoyed and angry. Who wants this stress when they are getting married? Messaged them hours and hours ago… and still waiting on a response. It’s the most infuriating thing ever. You wait forever for a response only to get asked a question you have already answered. Worst customer experience ever and I would never have expected this from the prices they charge. I have used them before ( I haven’t ordered from them in ages) with no issue so never expected this to happen. But at the end of the day all companies are great when things go well but it’s when there are issues like this that you really see what companies have customer service and theirs is absolutely awful.Update: over 2 weeks of constantly asking them what is going on I kept being told my case was passed to management and they are “awaiting a response” …. I would message every 3-4th day for an update and was told “ “we have chased our management for an answer and let you know when they respond ”… that was it I was finally told 18 days after my complaint I would be getting my refund and have now been refunded just under 3 weeks after complaining to them. £179 is a lot of money. They don’t offer free returns so I paid for the privilege  of being stressed out during my wedding trip and trying to chase my refund… I will definitely never use them again after this experience. With the prices they charge they need a better returns system so errors like this don’t happen so often and better customer service. Don’t ignore the bad reviews if you cannot afford to be out of pocket if something goes wrong!	2022-10-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/633b65a14a5fff53cad5a086	0.013949275362318849	neutral	["dress", "one", "sent", "returned", "back", "get", "told", "like", "response", "never"]
7681	houseofcb	Alice	The quality and design of the clothes are truly exceptional. I've always loved this brand, always fast deliveries. Purchase for 4 years; but my 2-star rating refers to the way they manage European customers (for the rest of the world I have no experience).Brexit was not their fault, yet most other British brands have found a way not to make us pay taxes and duties on their products (Rat&Boa-Oh Polly ecc..) HOCB instead, has not only raised the prices of everything, not only, there is always has been the difference between the prices in pounds and those in euros, but they have chosen not to worry about charging us with taxes and duties. Choice. And now you spend € 300 to buy a dress. I am sure that avarice is the cause of this choice. From a brand like yours, I would have expected a different treatment. I have not been shopping since they introduced this method. You should review this policy, because of customers like me, you have lost so many.	2021-12-15	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6336b53c3d107cfdfccf0f43	0.21858974358974356	neutral	["always", "brand", "way", "customers", "taxes", "duties", "prices", "choice", "like", "quality"]

They are insisting that the refund has been processed and completed; however, it is not showing up on my account and my credit card company cannot locate it either. House of CB is totally unhelpful and condescending when communicating via email. All they keep saying is the refund has been completed.

7687	houseofcb	Shania	They make the prettiest clothes!!!! I first went to the LA store at Melrose for try on, the store was very very busy, so I didn't expect much service but they still helped me to zip up and find me whatever I need. Their online fb assistant is also very helpful on sizing; Tallulah fits perfectly as they suggested and I needed to size up for some other styles that are less stretchy (I'd recommend everyone getting Tallulah it's the most complimented dress I have). So the try on was good, decided on getting white Tallulah and bought it online when they had a sale. Shipped from Asia but arrived super fast to the US. Then I got a set of bikinis, highest quality ever, very very cute and covers everything without slipping. LoveeeeeSome of their dress designs are uncommon in everyday clothing, so definitely try to find a store for try on before buying; otherwise, they have lots of sizes and the fabrics used are very high quality. Online customer service is superb, highly highly recommend.(Some think they are overpriced but they are definitely worth it!

I messaged house of CB to try to locate my dress asking for the picture of it being delivered or the signature and name of whoever signed for it. The dress was nearly £200 I didn’t agree for it to be delivered in a safe place or to a neighbour however was going to over look that as long as I could locate it. So far I’ve barely had a response from house of cb and the only thing they have said is to “wait” It’s there responsibility to ensure delivery, they are aware of this and have decided that going quiet is the best option.

Having not heard any thing regarding the replacement I contacted them via messenger and email on the 6/9 and have now had a response saying that it had been sent to management as the dress was returned soiled, which is absolute rubbish.

7693	houseofcb	Cat R	Believe it or not, my first order with HCB was for my wedding gown 🙈I have been following them for years seen all the reviews on YT. I had a last minute wedding dinner with just close family. I ordered the Elise wedding gown literally like 4 days before the dinner. I had a backup normal  dress in case I didn’t get it on time. It arrived the night before the party… omg ladies! This dress is unbelievably gorgeous, timeless, elegant! I’m the type of person that wears very loose black clothes. I’m not a fan of showing my figure. I’m a size L, I get very self conscious about my body but when I put this dress on…. I felt like amazing. It fit so perfect and looked beautiful. Everyone loved it. It arrived in a lovely white box beautifully wrapped. The quality exceeded my expectations! It has like a built in corset, and it has two elastic bands inside to really cinch the waist, it really creates that beautiful hourglass figure. It has the same quality of those super expensive bridal gowns like Pronovias, but HCB designs are something else! So grateful! Thanks for creating such amazing beautiful dresses!

7696	houseofcb	Charlotte	I used to love House of Cb. I have about 12 of there dresses still in my wardrobe over the past 7 years or so. But honestly recently I’m just not feeling it. Their sizing is just awful, their largest size (L+) for their new items just do not fit a UK 16 if you’re not their model shape of a 16 e.g. weight gain in your bum and hips only. No extra or minimal for a belly. I ordered one of their corset style dresses. I have satin dresses and coats from them over the years. The difference in sizing and quality of craftsmanship is eye watering. They used to be my go to fit occasion wear. Their new styles are just not it anymore, they get copied by PLT or oh polly even using the same models at times. Just cheapens the overall vibe and the aesthetic at the moment I just don’t think WOWs like it used it. Seems to be very much like the owner Conna and only what she wants to wear e.g. skinny girl now living in LA. Meh maybe I’m getting older so it’s not for me but everything is just wannabe classy when they used to be classy and now they’re not. Unsure if this is helpful but doesn’t help me be convinced to retry anything from their collections when the items cost a fortune, delivery too, usually things are out of stock so wait ages. If it doesn’t work out, you pay an arm and leg in shipping. Then they try to pretend they haven’t received it before you send through an employee signature of delivery. Wouldn’t recommend anymore.	2022-09-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/631311476a3e1ed2c3c87826	0.009969696969696967	neutral	["used", "dresses", "years", "sizing", "new", "items", "fit", "wear", "anymore", "like"]

Really reccomended! The dresses arrived in a super cute box and were lovely, I think the overall quality of the items are great even though maybe marginally overpriced; And a little s1utty I love the look but I feel this slits are a little bit too high or the tits are a bit too out but that’s just my personal style 🙈.

7704	houseofcb	Miranda	I have had my eye on House of CB for a while now and have bought a couple on Depop. But I was waiting for a special occasion to fork out that much for a new dress. I decided to splurge on a House of CB bikini for a yacht holiday to Croatia last minute so got next day delivery. A couple hours later I got a text saying the order would be delayed and delivered on the next business day. I got in touch with House of CB over email and Instagram DMs and they were super slow to reply on IG (and I never got an email back at all). I said I would repurchase with Saturday delivery if it wasn’t going to come in time but they continued to assure me it would - including when I was literally on the airplane they were still promising it would arrive??? Which was just so odd. I then asked for a refund and it took them ages to process it but I did eventually get one. At no point did they offer any apologies or consolations. They didn’t acknowledge that I splurged on a luxe bikini for a luxe holiday and it hadn’t arrived, and that they left it too late to communicate effectively with me to fix it or allow me to repurchase elsewhere. They never acknowledged it would be disappointing or different to their usual service. Until I called them out on all this. Unfortunately that’s written House of CB off for me because they’ve shown they’ve got budget customer service and a bad attitude to customers despite the luxury price tag. When I told friends about this, 2 said they’d had a similarly poor experience.	2022-08-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62ffeb8a7e1f0c3dc2e450fb	-0.06618223046794476	neutral	["got", "would", "house", "couple", "bikini", "holiday", "next", "day", "delivery", "email"]
7705	houseofcb	Carina Hos	I ordered a dress for House of CB for a wedding, the ordering process and time for the delivery was quick. I had done one order previously for a corset I was very happy with. However, all my hopes turned to dust when the first thing I noticed when opening the box was a stain on the dress itself. I immediately let customer service know about the stain, and sent over a picture. The dress ended up being in the wrong size anyhow, but what really got me was the customer service. It felt as though they had no understanding at all for my timeline or situation, as if I had inflicted the stain upon the dress myself. Instead of just exchanging it for a smaller size and a stain-less dress, I now just want my refund and will not be ordering from them again.

7706	houseofcb	Sophie Orton	I've had ongoing issues with House of Cb since March 2022. It's been the worst experience of online shopping and customer service in my life.I've posted several times on here about my horrific experience with them, how they ignored attempts to contact them and how they had me waiting for several months for a refund under the bs guise of a "technical error with their refund system".They've responded to one of my previous posts saying that I must have ordered from a scam company pretending to be them... This is honestly laughable. I have the literal order confirmation from them, all of the emails from them and messages saved from their official Instagram. They've then responded to a second post of mine saying that I was refunded on the 19th of May and 21st fo June. Another straight up lie. My literal bank statement shows that the refund (that I only received after threatening third party or legal involvement) has only recently gone back on the 25th of JULY.This will be the last time I complain about them or respond to anything they say because they've taken up far too much of my time already. They're a horrible company and there's definitely something dodgy going on behind the scenes. Avoid at all costs.	2022-08-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62f91d6b4c35e69ec52ccfab	-0.153030303030303	negative	["refund", "experience", "several", "responded", "saying", "company", "literal", "theyve", "time", "ive"]

7708	houseofcb	Phel Esha	Placed two orders, but did not get the confirmation email for one. I paid for both orders in full, but I did not receive one of the dresses in my last order. When I finally got in touch with someone (after multiple emails and messages on FB messenger), apparently they did not send this dress because I had it in the first order (although they took the money for it). The person I spoke to said they sent an email asking whether this dress was a duplicate order, but I have searched my junk and inbox and still haven't seen said email. Regardless, why was I charged for it?  Since I did not get a confirmation email, this is something that I could have easily overlooked. Even when I received the package, the invoice did not mention the dress they took the money for but did not send. It was not until I returned the dress that I did get and got the refund that I realised that I had spent £300+ but was only refunded £169 even though I sent everything that I got back. I have since gotten my refund but it took ages to hear back from someone. I would recommend shopping via Selfridges if you really want something from them, as customer service directly from House of CB is off-putting.	2022-08-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62f00aec8000af4a8857776b	0.09871794871794873	neutral	["email", "dress", "get", "order", "got", "took", "orders", "confirmation", "one", "someone"]

7711	houseofcb	N V	HOUSE OF CB IN THE MYER CENTRE SYDNEY! WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! BE AWARE LOCALS & VISITORS, IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR DAY RUINED BY A RUDE STAFF! Today was the worse customer service experience I had ever came across in my life! Not Isabella but Belle from House of CB in Sydney Myer Centre. I went there with my friend, as she was looking to buy a couple of dresses for her trip to Europe next week. I helped her choose a few, as it’s her fav store. As I was choosing one for her and finding her size, House of CB staff came up from behind me and started tidying the rack I was looking at angrily. I already notice she didn't say hi and if we were needing any service, but I was thinking maybe she's not having a great day and was tired… BUT!!! When she came pass me the second time and whacked the clothes on the rack that I was grabbing the dress for my friend from, because we were not getting any service - prompt me to ask the other staff Isabella who was lovely on processing the transaction her name. I'm not one to leave bad reviews, even when Qantas cancelled my flights I didn't leave a bad review, but I just need people to be aware of the appalling service that got me this upset. My friend said she would of bought more dresses but was disappointed in the negative service today by one of the staff. So disappointing, as I have also bought from there and won't be returning.	2022-07-26	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62dfa9ce8000af4a884b0d94	-0.175	negative	["service", "staff", "house", "came", "friend", "one", "myer", "centre", "sydney", "worse"]

7715	houseofcb	Kate Sharman	I wish I would have read reviews before I purchased. I had been planning on getting a dress from here for months for a wedding I am attending. I ordered three to try. I am a size 14 34FF and 5”9.One dress arrived after a couple of days and the other two over a week later, I had been emailing customer service who were very helpful and friendly who told me they still weren’t in the country but that same day, they were delivered.The packaging was lovely, maybe unnecessary but the dresses were cheap feeling and one of the hems wasn’t straight and it looked lopsided. I ordered the L and L+ one in the ‘large’ cup size. Both were ok for size in general but were quite cumbersome due to lots of badly stitched material. The bust was ridiculous, I don’t know how the models look so good in it because honestly if you’re over a B cup I wouldn’t even try it. Even if the bust was ok, the waist was too baggy, hips too tight. Just so wrong. I’m so disappointed as these are fairly expensive dresses. The worst part was the returns, you have to pay for them and this wasn’t made obvious upon checkout. It cost me £8 to return due to all the packaging being so heavy and it’s impossible to fold the dresses neatly enough back in the packaging boxes too. I don’t say any of this out of spite, I just think when they are selling themselves as luxury then the products and service should follow through. In the end, I’ve got a £50 dress from Abercrombie.	2022-07-15	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d0f8764c35e69ec50f9a04	-0.047044334975369445	neutral	["dress", "size", "packaging", "dresses", "ordered", "try", "service", "one", "cup", "due"]
7716	houseofcb	Eleni Daniilidou	I do not understand how house of cb is considered a good brand. In my opinion, material is indeed excellent but the way they are made is horrible. Fitting is nothing like a designer’s brand, lines focused on details. Also sizes are misleading, they fit only specific body shapes which are slim and no breasts, even if you go for bigger sizes. I really like the designs but i’m done with house of cb. Extremely poorly made regarding fitting from my experience, which makes me wonder how that many celebrities with Beyonce’s body type wear it. That’s not possible, only if their clothes are actually tairored.	2022-07-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d031358000af4a884016f7	0.16	neutral	["house", "brand", "made", "fitting", "like", "sizes", "body", "understand", "considered", "good"]
7717	houseofcb	Nicky	Now my go to place to buy dresses for events! I ordered multiple dresses to try on for my university graduation ceremony and each came packaged very well and in good condition. Dresses are beautiful and high quality, you definitely get your money's worth. However, I must say, some of the dress sizes are unreliable as a small in one dress just about didn't fit (zipper couldn't zip up at the top of my back) but fit in the other two. But I'm assuming this is because the stretch factor on the initial dress was stated as 1/3 on their website, whilst on the other two the stretch factor was 2/3. This is particularly the case if you have a larger bust as the 'bigger cup' size varies slightly from one dress to the next which can be annoying as you're not sure how the fit will be. I must also mention that the customer service is really good. I reached out to them by email on two different occasions, one was enquiring about when a dress size may be restocking, and the other was about my refund. On both occasions my email was answered the next working day with helpful information and a pleasant tone. Both of the dresses I returned were processed for refund within the stated 1-2 working days. Very pleased since they were quite costly and I wanted the money back quickly 😅. This is just my experience with them as someone who lives in London, England. Not sure how it is with different parts of the country and overseas as I've read some of the other reviews on here that detail some poor customer service.	2022-07-14	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d024784c35e69ec50f0c23	0.11076190476190476	neutral	["dress", "dresses", "one", "fit", "two", "good", "must", "back", "stretch", "factor"]

7721	houseofcb	Peter Scott	An extremely disappointing experience. I have never bought from this company before as I have always been bored by their designs, but on search for a graduation dress it seemed like an okay place for a dress. I ordered my dress 2 weeks before graduation using next day delivery, it never arrived. I then placed the order again but in the panic of it not arriving I visited one of their shops. The one in the Arndale Centre? Every single member of staff was laughably incapable, I do not understand how from what I thought of a pretty well know high street brand to have such painfully useless staff. I’m not sure how a brand that is literally marketed on ‘pretty’ things could have such an ugly store but that was barely the problem. The staff were horrendously unapproachable and it seemed that their own conversations were more important than the customers. I tried on a few dresses (which can I point out I think I could have found something better in an Oxfam) I then asked one of their sales staff whom looked like a 15 year old if she had any other sizes of one of the dresses that I tried and if she could grab me anything similar. To which she said yes (hoorah), I then shut the curtain and she went on to discuss how annoying I was to her other seemingly 15? year old co worker. She came back with the dress in a medium (I’m a size 6), and said ‘there’s nothing else similar’ - it was black midi dress. A black midi dress perhaps the most basic dresses of them all, which I had seen at least 10 of when I walked in. I digress, I would highly suggest you work on your ‘recruitment’ and using parcel force to deliver your clothing - what a waste of time. To anyone wanting to use this company, take your money elsewhere and support a company that deserves your custom.	2022-07-08	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/62c82fdb0c20b4453c33b85a	-0.032421768707483	neutral	["dress", "one", "staff", "company", "could", "dresses", "never", "graduation", "seemed", "like"]
7722	houseofcb	Caridad Fortune	It's a shame that I have to put a star on this review.I purchased a dress back in May and it didn't fit. I used their.size guide and the dress didn't fit. I decided to return the first dress and order another a size up- still an issue. Basically the bust area was to small for me. I noticed that the company gives you 14 days to return the merchandise and I sent the dress back immediately. I waited 2 weeks and didn't see my refund.  So I reached out by email and was told it would appear within 10 days depending on who I bank with.I patiently waited the 10 days and still didn't see a refund. I reached out AGAIN to see what the delay was and was told...I should receive shortly. I reached out to my bank and was told that their was no refund issued from House of CB. I am furious because they withdraw the money immediately but do not do the same in regards to refunds. Now I have no choice but to reach out to my bank again to file a dispute. I really thought highly of this company but now I know better...never again will I purchase from them!!!

I ordered an item from them with such joy and was extremely excited only for it to arrive all scrunched up the collars were extremely deformed and unwearable. I paid £79 for this on sale and though I know their policy of refunding in gift vouchers I thought due to the item arriving on an unwearable condition they would be able to refund me for it as it’s a lot of money. I really don’t fancy purchasing with them again after my first ever experience. I emailed them, tweeted them and after telling me it’s not manufactured faulty they refused to refund me. After I raised with them with pics and videos of the blazer they stopped replying to me. Absolutely hideous disgusting customer service. I really want my money back as I have no desire purchasing from this site ever againI am hoping to god someone in their customer service will be sensible enough to refund me for my money.

I picked out quite a few items as I went around the shop and these were taken straight into a designated changing room for me, so I could continue looking. The service was excellent throughout, including within the changing room as well, where Rachel M was on hand to help with any assistance whilst changing (undoing zips and fastening clips etc), as well as instantly going to look for different sizes.

I sent back the item for an exchange, and royal mail confirmed the item was delivered by special delivery and signed for. I contacted the repeatedly to get an update as I needed the item for an event. They responded once after 3-4 days and nothing after that. Considering how expensive their garments are, and how established they are as a business, I would expect far better. And atleast have an adequate return process that does not infringe on the customer. You end up paying more for the item.

7735	houseofcb	Debbie	Sadly, the company does not stick to the online retail laws for issuing refunds (if the item is deemed not suitable). They have devised their own policy that if the item is in the sale, then the customer is not entitled to a refund, only a gift card. This is a lie, the online laws do not change because an item goes in the sale. The law stays the same, as you can not try the item on before purchasing. A policy is not the law. I was told by trading standards I was entitled to a full refund (as I suspected) and another regulatory body also agreed. They advised me to write to the company several times and quote the online retail laws etc. The company has refused to take their advice and ignored the last letter. Very unprofessional and unethical. I was advised to take legal action to get my money back.Update 2024:The company still has my money (coming up 2 yrs this summer). There's been a lot of back and fourth with an unscrupulous manager. I would avoid this time wasting exercise and go down the legal route. The final outcome was that the Manager stated they had written in small print on their website about no refund (only giftcard) and I must have agreed to it.  So in a nutshell this implies it's my fault, No!!!! This manager is gaslighting, as regardless of what they have written you are still legally entitled to a refund for sales goods. Don't be fooled! Due to the emotional abuse tactics, holding my money and the law not being adhere too, I should be getting compensation from them!! Not just the price of my dress back!  Notice how the house of CB never reply to me on here, as none of them will discuss what the online retails laws actually say!! If they comment, it will never be about what the law actually says.......	2022-06-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6298d987d557309563095c0b	0.024768518518518513	neutral	["company", "online", "laws", "item", "refund", "law", "entitled", "money", "manager", "retail"]

7739	houseofcb	Amber	I purchased a dress from the house of CB for the first time and I was blown away by the dress. I almost always have to get any dress I purchase altered for the perfect fit, however, that was not the case with the dress from the house of Cb. The dress fit like a glove and the quality is top notch!! I purchased the Charmaine corset dress and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I'm 5’1 and 125 pounds and the dress feels like it was made just for me. I can't wait to purchase more items from this brand.	2022-05-24	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/628ceeef4b16276ac98f1094	0.5552083333333333	positive	["dress", "purchase", "purchased", "house", "fit", "like", "first", "time", "blown", "away"]
7740	houseofcb	Emily Pack	Do NOT order online. Honestly, don't do it. If you're going to choose to get a dress from House of CB go to the store or in my opinion, avoid completely. I sent back my £500+ parcel of dresses with the shortest "skirts" if you can call them that. I paid £12 for special delivery on 26th of April got an email back on 3rd of May saying my refund was processed and I should receive it within 10 days max. Still nothing. FOUR WEEKS ago I sent it back and no money. Customer service is awful. I read the bad reviews and discarded them, don't make the same mistake and just AVOID. I will be escalating this and seeking legal action as this company cannot keep getting away with stealing from people. I urge anyone with a similar issue to do the same, have a look on the gov website regarding companies legal obligations and how to escalate further.	2022-05-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/628b8c96045d025d3a9c198b	-0.008928571428571414	neutral	["back", "dont", "avoid", "sent", "legal", "order", "online", "honestly", "youre", "going"]

What does it mean there was a technical problem while making a refund? There isn't any technical problem when receiving the money, but there is when giving it back. I've been waiting for a month.

Literally tried to steal my money until I escalated it through one of the websites that help with claims.

Quality is meh. Haven seen worse, have seen better. What is more shocking is the price tag for the quality - definitely not worth it.

I’ve bought many dresses for occasions from here over the years and they always stand the rest of time. But recently I had an amazing in store experience too. The Manchester Arndale staff were incredibly helpful, I really can’t say I would have walked away having bought a dress (having not been in the mood and trying on dresses in the wrong size) if it wasn’t for their friendly assistance. If you want to have a browse I would definitely pop to your local store. But also I really recommend the customer service team, they’re always helpful and friendly, I really have no complaints.

7765	houseofcb	Nisa	This is the worst shop online. The dresses here are not worth the prices? What’s the difference between house of Cb and cheaper dresses? The cheaper dresses do not have damaged zips. So I purchased a dress it’s always drama with this company whenever you purchase a item that’s faulty. I have had a problem with 3 sirene dresses the zips don’t go past a certain point after wearing them. I purchased that had this issue, when the dress is off it zips when it’s on it won’t fully go up. The dress is my size it’s actually a bit loose I realised the zip issues because I was planning on getting it altered from the bottom. This dress is BRAND NEW with tags on yet they won’t accept it as a return when they’ve gave me a faulty item. I have spent lots of money with them over the years the staff instore also have a attitude on as if they’re working for some high end top class brand when this is literally a low street shop. I will not be spending any money with them and save myself from a headache. This is the only shop where I feel like I have to be rude when I’m contacted them to get my point across. I will also be reporting them,	2022-04-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/624d97bc2b3c3c43cfca8e6d	-0.06663644048259434	neutral	["dresses", "dress", "shop", "zips", "cheaper", "purchased", "item", "faulty", "point", "brand"]
7766	houseofcb	Sophie	The sizing of this brand is ridiculous. I have recently bought a corset top. I originally wanted the size M (bigger cup) which is what I would normally select. I’m normally a size M in similar brands like oh Polly. They didn’t have the M but had an L (bigger cup) in stock. I ordered it even thought I thought it would be a little big, but I do have a larger chest so was quietly optimistic.I’m a size 10/12 and 34DD.What they sent me was actually the L+ the largest size possible and their bigger cup size supposedly for size D-E chests… It is quite literally the largest size that they carry and It doesn’t even zip up.To say I’m shocked is an understatement (reading the other reviews it looks like I’m not the only one). There’s nothing wrong with being a size L or L+ of course but when your largest possible doesn’t fit a size 10/12… yikes.If you’re over a size 10 honestly don’t bother with this company. As for the “bigger cup” literally where? That’s a normal cup size that would fit a C cup comfortably at most. Honestly, you’d think these clothes were supposed to be for children.	2022-03-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6245cee2c7628b203b9e8a56	0.07068452380952382	neutral	["size", "cup", "bigger", "would", "largest", "normally", "like", "even", "thought", "possible"]

7768	houseofcb	C	Recently, I've finally realized what exactly my style is. And with spring/summer coming up, I decided it was time to start shopping. I found out about House of CB through a YouTuber called Pretty Pastel Please, who was raving about the dresses from here. So, I decided to give 'em a try.Honestly, I couldn't be happier with all of my new items from House of CB. I was hesitant to order at first, due to some negative reviews on this website. However, I now own the Gracie corset top in pink, the Tallulah dress in lemon and the Alicia dress in white floral. They came packaged beautifully and the quality is unlike anything I've ever owned before. They're worth every single penny.One of the things I was kind of worried about was the sizing. I'm pretty tall (I'm dutch lol), so ordering online can be taking a wild guess sometimes. I'm usually a medium, though, and that's also my size with this brand. Also, my measurements correspond to the measurements in the sizing chart. Therefore, I'd say they are true to size.I actually ordered the Tallulah dress in a large at first (just to be sure), but I returned that one and ordered a medium instead (which I kept and fits like a dream). The shipping time is exactly as described on the website and I received my refund for the returned dress in a timely manner.I'd like to end this review by saying how positively surprised I was with the customer service. I don't resonate with the negative reviews I've read on here at all.I'm definitely buying more from House of CB! 🌸	2022-03-30	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/624466f92b3c3c43cfc36d2d	0.2079041648007165	neutral	["dress", "ive", "house", "exactly", "decided", "time", "pretty", "first", "negative", "reviews"]

7770	houseofcb	Christina Kim	I ordered a size Small top based off their size guide chart and the item I received was 10 inches smaller than their website said. A size small bust should be 34-36.5 inches per their site, yet the top I got was 24”. It literally could fit a 12 year old child. I was appalled and emailed the company right away with photos for proof and an entire explanation. Long story short, they are still making me buy my OWN shipping return label for an item they sent that was not true to size. Their site also states  “Item runs true to size chart and is cut to suit our size chart. Please refer to our size chart for the best fit. Do not size up or down.“ I just don’t understand if I ordered correctly based off THEIR size chart, after they guaranteed it’s so run true to their chart, and I received an item completely wrong then described, why I would pay to have the item returned to them. The representative helping me in the email literally replied with “we do not offer return labels, sorry!” I was left speechless. I would understand if these clothes were cheap, but they’re not. I just feel so scammed and I feel like there’s nothing I can do about it.	2022-03-22	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/623a6012d9248a7b46c7afb9	0.09044168391994478	neutral	["size", "chart", "item", "true", "ordered", "small", "top", "based", "received", "inches"]

The girl in the store said: " Oh yeah we're getting new ones in but keeping the faulty ones incase anyone still wants to buy them " are you kidding me? The zips were completely broken and the seams were coming out of the bottom of the dresses, totally unacceptable especially when you consider the price you pay.Also sizing is totally off - I'm a 12 and I fit into an xl. Got another dress delivered by post and it hasn't arrived despite the fact it was supposed to be here Friday for a friends wedding. Will never be ordering from house of cb or going into their store again.	2022-03-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/622fb90731617ac0e4865571	0.042045454545454546	neutral	["store", "faulty", "waited", "dresses", "ones", "totally", "went", "stratford", "hours", "queue"]

7776	houseofcb	Olivia	Ordered a dress on Tuesday and I was pleasantly surprised to have it arrive 2 days later on Thursday. The dress is amazing quality, definitely worth the high price tag. However, the sizing is incredibly off with House of CB. I am 5'4, size 10-12 (always, without fail, a size S-M with every other brand). I'd ordered a corset from House of CB in the past but it was one size too small, so bearing this in mind I ordered size L for the dress to be on the safe side. I tried it on when it arrived and I couldn't even zip it up - it fits everywhere except my waist. I'm guessing House of CB tailors more for the hourglass figure and assumes your waist is small.My advice - order 1 size up, or go for 2 sizes up if you have a bigger waist. I have absolutely no idea how they show the dresses on plus size models on the website. I am definitely not a L+ with other brands.	2022-03-10	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6229f4c231617ac0e48228ff	0.106875	neutral	["size", "ordered", "dress", "house", "waist", "definitely", "tuesday", "pleasantly", "surprised", "arrive"]
7777	houseofcb	Nat Mac	I ordered a beautiful dress from House of CB for a wedding. As the company was based in the UK i was prepared to pay any excess charges incurred due to Brexit (I live in Ireland) but instead , the company sent my dress from their European office meaning I had no excess to pay. I really appreciated this. On arrival, my dress was beautifully packaged in a stunning grey box with a ribbon attached. The dress inside was wrapped carefully in tissue paper. The dress was made from exquisite fabric, felt heavy (in a really good quality way) and I couldn't wait to try it on. Unfortunately for me, the small was just a little too tight so I wanted to return it and exchange for a larger size. This was made easy with a return form that was easy to fill out. A week or so later I was contacted by the team who told me that, unfortunately, the dress wasn't available in my size but they would happily return my money or I could exchange for another dress. I chose another beautiful dress in the same style but different colour. The House of CB team remained in regular contact with me and confirmed that my order had been processed. They encouraged me to contact them should I need anything else. House of CB are the prime example of what an online boutique should be!. I was never left to worry as they always replied to messages both on Facebook messenger and by email. I can't wait to have an excuse to purchase another item from them . The quality of their clothing and their attention to detail has made shopping with them a fantastic experience and has renewed by faith in online shopping	2022-03-08	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6227325c445f5107dcab5b0c	0.19070835078899595	neutral	["dress", "house", "made", "return", "another", "beautiful", "company", "pay", "excess", "really"]

7785	houseofcb	Millie Milner	BEWARE: They don’t cover the cost of returns and there returns warehouse is in Spain, the cost of return for a large wedding dress is exorbitant/incredibly high. I had to pay £140 to return a dress. - it then got stuck at customs for 4 months - and I still have not had my money back after all this hassle. I brought a £800 wedding dress online, which looked nothing like the picture & the material felt really cheap (the colour was like a pale yellow, not ivory/cream or white… YELLOW, the fit was odd and the dress was far to big even the smallest size) - but no worries right, I’ll just return it. WRONG. My mistake, I didn’t realise House of CB didn’t cover the cost of returns - I thought I was just shipping it back to a returns depot in the UK, however you have to ship it back to Spain - It cost me £60 in order to return the dress due to how big it was. This isn’t the worst part though, my return was held at customs in Spain for nearly 4 months so I contacted them to ask what was going on. They said House of CB refuse to accept the return as they refuse to pay the custom fees as the dress was worth £800 (in case the parcel got lost) - so they returned the dress to me. When they returned the dress to me I had to pay £20 in custom fees. I contacted House of CB about this and they were unhelpful and said I need to return the parcel again but declare the dress as less then £100 (when the dress is worth over £800) - this is crazy, as what happens if the dress gets lost or damaged - I loose £800? So I’m total, I’ve had to spend £140 in returning a wedding dress. BEWARE: They don’t cover the cost of returns and there returns warehouse is in Spain, the cost of return for a large wedding dress is exorbitant/incredibly high.	2022-02-22	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6214bedce0365cc27e75d205	-0.007813729480396143	neutral	["dress", "return", "cost", "returns", "spain", "wedding", "\\u00a3800", "cover", "pay", "back"]

There was no longer a zipper or slit and the feathers and material were completely different. When asked about it they said this is how they make it now but the pictures did not represent this! Then when I wanted to return it because it was a different cheaper tight dress (one that looks identical to cheaper ones on amazon) they said they wouldn't provide return shipping.

It took 3 PEOPLE to zip me into a medium sized house of cb dress which ended up being baggy on me ANYWAY. I had invested so much time into losing weight and purchased from house of cb because I expected so much better from this brand.

However, when I recieved the items the dress was stained and the gloves too big. I therefore returned the items- THE VERY SAME DAY with only 1.5 hours in between, all tags attached. I filled in the return form and informed of the state of the dress . However, the House of CB recently got back to me and stated that "I didnt follow their return guidelines" and therefore would not get my £300 in return. Instead, I have to pay postal costs if I want to have the STAINED (!) dress and too big gloves back. And when I want talk to someone from the company , they do not even have a phone number. Only e-mail contact. THIS IS A FRAUD COMPANY who steals from their customers.

7811	houseofcb	Jessica Brown	The sizing guide is where the experience falls down for me.Actual quality of the garment and style is lovely - priced at a higher price point, but it's nice to see lined dresses and details like how stretchy the fabric is listed on the website.The sizing however. Oh boy. House of CB specifies on many of their garments to stick to the sizing guide and not size up or down. All of the dresses are measured for a snug fit. I measured myself and I apparently fall within the L range for House of CB. When the Cornelia dress arrived, it was so loose and swimming in fabric. Nothing about it is fitted like the photography shows. I have to assume from this that the sizing guide is way off. I'm trying to exchange for a S size now, but adding to the frustrating experience is the lack of prepaid return/exchange labels.For that reason, I probably won't order from House of CB again - there's only 5 sizes to pick from and the lack of specific sizing means you have to guess what'll fit you best. Their sizing guide allows for a lot of room for error. Given the cost of the garment and the returns process, it's just not worth it.	2022-01-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/61d0cbfe0430e828ebe50388	0.18413105413105413	neutral	["sizing", "guide", "house", "experience", "garment", "dresses", "like", "fabric", "size", "measured"]
7812	houseofcb	Ellie	Love the quality of the dresses from House of CB. The whole experience is top tier. The packaging, the fast service and the way it looks on is perfection.

I felt so elegant & confident and got so many compliments!	2021-12-31	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/61cf483e9f60695a25061235	0.37083333333333335	positive	["dresses", "house", "love", "quality", "whole", "experience", "top", "tier", "packaging", "fast"]
7813	houseofcb	Taylor	There are multiple imposter websites of house of CB, as I learned the hard way. Houseofcb.com is a real website… and I’m a big fan of their clothing. “Thehouseofcb.com” and “houseofcbsale.com” (and I imagine other similar domains) appear to be owned by the sale domain owner. Web searching found these sites are run out of Hong Kong under a company called Linhope International Ltd. Orders from these websites were billed for “Maria Sanchez” on the bank statement. They are non-responsive to email. The domain owner is hidden on WhoIs. These domains appear to be fraudulent (granted, I have an untrained eye).	2021-12-29	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/61cbdaf30430e828ebe17fa3	-0.04791666666666666	neutral	["websites", "domains", "appear", "domain", "owner", "multiple", "imposter", "house", "learned", "hard"]

Unfortunately the gift package was damaged due to transportation. The item was fine but the gift box wasn’t nice anymore. I have reached the customer service officers  Lucia, Andrea, Nikki, Mia . Thanks you guys for amazing job to following up until the end to replace a new gift box for me and I got in just right before the Christmas Eve day. I know how you have been busy with lots of orders and enquiries everyday but you still take time and follow up with my case. It showed your commitment with clients and your caring which is very important to make clients satisfaction .

7816	houseofcb	RP	I was able to go into the Melrose location in LA, and tried on the “Bea” corset. I had low expectations since I wear the smallest bra size (32A) and these types of styles of corsets are always too big for my small frame. But the Bea was so flattering!! I was astonished it fit so well and hugged me in all the right areas + worked with my small curves and accentuates what you’ve got! Super sexy and flattering, would definitely buy more styles in the future. ♥️	2021-12-21	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/61c246569f60695a25fc8f7d	0.15132688492063492	neutral	["bea", "styles", "small", "flattering", "able", "melrose", "location", "tried", "corset", "low"]

7823	houseofcb	Sarah	I've bought from House of CB in the past & it was fine but I bought a corset top and the size was just wrong? On the size chart the measurements say a small is 34-36.5 inch bust & 25.5 - 28 inch waist which fits my size. However when it arrived the actual sizing was that of an XS. Feels like false advertising. Really annoying that I had to pay to return this garment when I had no reasonable way of knowing the garment was the wrong size and this feels like an error on their part. Also they won't pay for a refund, they're only offering an exchange. Really disappointing and I'd be worried to order with them again as I can't trust the sizing on the website.	2021-12-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/61bb1d680430e828ebd4b60e	-0.20694444444444446	negative	["size", "bought", "wrong", "inch", "sizing", "feels", "like", "really", "pay", "garment"]

7825	houseofcb	Paola Garcia	I placed an order for my Birthday dress over three weeks ahead even though it said “three day shipping”. It had been three days past the delivery date and there were no location updates. I contact them and UPS and they finally shipped my package after I sent a list claim (they probably lost it and didn’t notice it wasn’t moving until I asked). The dress finally got here the Monday of my birthday party (a week after it should’ve) and unfortunately it was too big. I contacted them to see if they could ship a smaller size in time for the party (since the claim 2-3 day shipping and I still had 4 days to the party). They told me to place the order and they would monitor it. Two days later UPS still says they have not received the package. I have to contact them yet again and tell them it won’t get here on time and if they haven’t delivered the package I want it cancelled. The next day there is finally a location on UPS and they let me know it can’t be cancelled and will get here on Monday when I needed it by Saturday. They have no idea where their packages are and both times they weren’t shipped until I contacted them which is not something a costumer should have to do. Very disappointed in this company since they failed me with the delivery both times, once by OVER a week and only after I set up a claim!Update: the second dress got here two weeks after the delivery date they gave me. They said a signature would be required and that I could decline delivery so it would be sent back to them. No signature was required and now I am stuck with another dress that I will have to pay to return. Nothing their company every told me was true and they have horrible control of their shipping.

I had brought a dress with a suggested date of arrival between 5-7 days, but after 5 working days and having received no more information around despatched I contacted customer services via House of CB via Facebook. On top of having the longest response time, the agent was less than helpful and advising that they could not advise on a delivery date and the resolution was to cancel the order. I don’t understand how that is a good resolution when I clearly ordered the dress because I wanted it.

7853	houseofcb	Faith Elizabeth Hanson	Ordered a dress and it’s not the same colour as advertised at all!!!! Got a pinky red colours dress and in the photos the dress looked brown/dark red colour. . . .Not only that but the sizes don’t accommodate curves at all. I have an extreme hip to waist ratio, the large dress fits my hips but is baggy everywhere else . . . I can’t win. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Quality of the dress was lovely, zip is weak though. Colour advertised was misleading, image is obviously photoshopped. I won’t be buying from house of cb again. The sizing just doesn’t compliment my hips or buttocks 🤦🏻‍♀️ Not even have my bbl yet 😂	2021-10-06	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/615dfd5ab873f1f75f58955d	0.10142857142857142	neutral	["dress", "colour", "advertised", "red", "hips", "\\ud83e\\udd26\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f", "ordered", "got", "pinky", "colours"]

One is made with a thin, cheap ribbon for the straps. The other one had such a long corset that went beyond any normal length torso for a Small.

The second was ordered after a promo (which of course I missed) and it took 12 days. The third dress I had to exchange sizes. The exchange took 17 days from when I dropped it off at the post office until it got back to me. I did email customer service for the second dress just to see where it was, after I realized seven days passed. They answered by the next day and it was actually already with Parcel Force.

7868	houseofcb	Lucy	So disappointed with this service as some of the clothing items are amazing and make you feel great! On the other hand there are some serious faults with this company that need addressing and I won’t be ordering again unless they look to improve. First of all their sizing is all over the place- I’ve ordered some items in a small that don’t fit but when I order the medium it’s way too big?! The worst thing about this is that they don’t cover the postage- I’ve spent at least £30 just trying to return all these items! It’s so not justified considering they are a large brand now and make so much money. I’ve also had countless dresses break or start to come apart after a few wears so the quality simply isn’t there or worth paying for.

7871	houseofcb	Kathryn G.	I cannot say enough wonderful things about the quality of the Anja dress, as well as the House of CB customer service. I ordered the Anja dress in ivory to wear to my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding and when it arrived a month or two before my wedding, I fell in love with it. The structure, boning, and fit on the dress hits and pulls you in in all of the right places. Plus, the fabric is buttery and beautiful. My mother even commented that she was shocked that I only paid $200 based on the quality of the dress. Two weeks before the wedding, I took the dress to the dry cleaners and they absolutely RUINED it on accident. I was devastated because I loved this dress so much and it was sold out when I went on to order another. I reached out to the House of CB customer service, and even though it was not even remotely close to their fault it problem, they took it upon themselves to help me find another dress and even gave me free two day shipping to ensure it would arrive by my wedding day. I am eternally grateful!

7876	houseofcb	Abiel	This company make it as difficult as possible to send returns. please be aware of that before buying.I bought a dress from them in July and the fit and style were beautiful however the lining was polyester and pilled terribly after one wear. I dont expect this from a £130 dress. after being told i cant return a worn item, i explained my statutory rights as a customer were to return faulty goods for a refund, replacement or repair. They then refused a return based on me having the dress longer than 4 weeks (2.5 weeks of which were spent back and forth with the company, trying to get a return address) I sent the dress back at my own expense, they denied receipt but had signed for it? this is when it got ridiculous.They insisted I had washed the dress, and said the faults were evident but it was under management review??? they then continued to ignore my emails, in possession of both my money and the dress! I took it to trading standards which I suggest everyone does as they were brilliant. House of CB have blocked me on 2 instagram accounts for advising other customers with the same problems go to Trading standards. so many women in the same boat having been scammed by this company.Fortunately I opened a case with my Credit card company and they sided with me after submitting images and emails, they have taken the money back from House of CB and I finally have a resolution. Please beware when shopping with them, there are serious issues within their company.	2021-09-16	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/614302c3215cfcced2675b1a	0.09232456140350877	neutral	["dress", "company", "return", "back", "please", "weeks", "emails", "money", "trading", "standards"]

7879	houseofcb	Jessica Evans	Today I received 3 £129 dresses in different colours. I only opened one dress which was excessively crumpled. This do not represent the extremely luxurious price it commands. I ordered large plus which is supposed to be a 14-16. I think half of a breast fit in the top.. my friend who is a firm 12 didn’t fit in it either. Worst above all though is the £16 it cost me to return.. it would have cost £26 with Royal Mail to cover the cost of insurance to get it back safely. It’s a £350 order which meant I couldn’t just pay the basic postage cost that would cover me for £20 if lost. It is YOUR dresses that are cheap and nasty, cut badly and arrive in hideous condition. Why do I have to pay £20 in total to have these posted and then returned.. for nothing!! Such a depressing way to spend £20. Only use this company if you are CERTAIN it will fit you and you like wasting your money on overpriced clothes.	2021-09-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6140f8126223e22118b08999	-0.04221230158730158	neutral	["cost", "fit", "\\u00a320", "dresses", "would", "cover", "pay", "today", "received", "\\u00a3129"]

7883	houseofcb	Stephanie Joseph	After hearing about this online store and it’s good quality I decided to purchase the ‘Spotlight’ dress. I was very excited and the dress seemed like good quality when it came in. I wore it for the first time at a bridal shower and while I was at the table the strap completely broke. It was embarrassing. I explained what happened to customer service and requested a refund but they said they’d only reimburse me for repairs up to $15 by sending a receipt or I return the dress (I would have to pay to ship it back) for them to determine if they can even accept the return with the possibility that they could send it back anyway since I wore it. I thought at the very least they’d send another dress to replace the broken one. I am disappointed given the price I paid.

You’d think after paying such high prices for two dresses you’d get the same level of service but unfortunately this is not the case with house of cb also it being a brand in london you’d also think the customer service would be very helpful but again not the case! My package containing items worth £175 never received after giving special instructions on redelivery to send to my local post office even confirming this house of cb customer service and parcel force agent this was not done! House of cb taking way too long to get this sorted when this was their fault! I ordered over a week in advance for an event in london I had to make last minute changes which I was glad I did because oh polly really pulled through with their outfits and ensure they deliver to the correct house!	2021-08-31	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/612eb7b5cc0087e8ef6a9e40	0.019587912087912104	neutral	["house", "service", "customer", "never", "think", "get", "case", "also", "london", "shambolic"]

After asking for help on my refund on the 02/09/2001, I have now been told I will have to wait a further 1-2 weeks. ******PLEASE DON'T ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY**** I can't even ring anyone.

Customer service has sent me the same message each time I enquired about my order that they “have no idea when I will receive and I can get a refund if I want” that’s all.

This never showed up, I contacted HouseofCB only to be told it’s my responsibility to sort with my bank and handed a ARN and RRN code (which the bank wouldn’t even acknowledge). It’s evident that their plan is to ask you to claim the funds back from your bank and keep your money and your item you have returned to then scam the next victim.

Every time I contact them they send me an ARN number and an RRN number in order to contact the bank to trace the refund however, the bank are unable to locate the refund.

7909	houseofcb	Edina Carlyle	I have bought clothes here twice. Each time a terrible disappointment. The size charts are inaccurate. the first time based on the size chart THEY provide i ordered an x-small. When I received it It was laughable. The dress was tiny. i didnt want to pay for a return, and risk losing my refund as I had already seen complaints of how difficult to return things. So i gave it a second shot with this top I ordered that I had wanted for so long. Again, based on the size chart AND my past experience, I order small. The top arrives and not only is it MEGA cheap material, the top is huge. And apparently, from what others are sharing, even returning the item unused/unworn its not refunded, So i guess i just bought a really expensive rag to use to clean my toilets.	2021-08-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6126477ceb6de7284e276a96	-0.035964912280701776	neutral	["size", "top", "bought", "time", "based", "chart", "ordered", "return", "clothes", "twice"]

Finally went to the shop and tried on a Large in another style which fit perfectly. Bought the dress online and when trying it on, didn’t fit due to a cheap zipper.

7912	houseofcb	Laura	Ordered 2 dresses and had to send both back as they didn’t fit. Cost me £15 to return them as they don’t do free returns. Was told on 4th august they had been refunded, however funds are still not in my account. I contacted customer service via email and social media several times to be told the refund has been processed and I need to contact the bank. The bank has confirmed every time I’ve called them there is no refund pending on my account. House of cb gave me a ARN number to give to the bank to trace the refund, again the bank said no refund pending. Told house of fb this and they’ve said there’s nothing more they can do seems they’ve washed their hands with the situation. Over 2 weeks and still £250 down. Fuming to say the least. Will never shop here again and will warn other people not to as well.UPDATE 30th August still no refund and absolutely no word from House of CB.

Its a whole experience from the divine collections to scroll through, to the tech-easy online shopping to the fast delivery, impeccable packaging... but most importantly, the retail. Their quality is insane. Its just made to make any woman, any body, feel good chic and luxurious (and lets not forget sexy). If you are on social media and post their stuff and tag them, they tend to do a follow up with everyone to let you know they love you in their clothes. Honestly, like many many people all over the world, I’m absolutely obsessed and in love with this female owned and empowering brand.

7914	houseofcb	Kaitlyn	The dress I ordered definitely was not worth the money, which is a shame as I was really looking forward to wearing it. However upon learning how to return it I find that you have to PAY to return the item? I think this is ludicrous considering it is a store with no physical shops so if something doesn’t fit or isn’t quite right then you have to pay for that. I think it’s just unfair and bad customer service. I have also emailed TWICE with questions and had zero response. I would say there are much better places to spend your money and I 100% won’t be shopping here again.	2021-08-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/611e44b76e38167b798ac093	0.0039682539682539915	neutral	["money", "return", "pay", "think", "dress", "ordered", "definitely", "worth", "shame", "really"]

After trying it on, I took it straight off and put it back into the packaging to be sent back as damaged and faulty. I then received an email saying that they can see signs the dress was worn which is impossible as not worn the dress outside. I’ve not even worn it for more than two seconds to try on and claiming that they will only offer me a repair and to send it back up my cost. this is disgusting service, considering the dress ruined My birthday celebration  luckily I had bought something else from them, that same day that I’ve kept but them refusing to offer any sort of refund or credit it’s just disgusting and I will never be shopping with them again.	2021-08-12	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6114db9cf9f4870a2806f111	-0.13676470588235295	negative	["dress", "back", "birthday", "worn", "service", "bought", "lockdown", "impossible", "offer", "disgusting"]

I did and my products never arrived and they don't get back to you. My bank luckily reversed the transaction and I got my money back. I also see some people are complaining about bad quality clothes from house of cb. This is from the SCAM Australia site. Their clothes gets shipped from HongKong. So it is not the legit house of cb clothing, but you still pay a fortune for it. I haven't ordered from House of CB London yet, but from videos on YouTube I saw that their clothes are beautiful. I contacted House of CB on Instagram and they told me the other site is a scam. I see the scam website still pops up first when you google house of cb.

It's now Thursday morning and I have had an email from House of CB confirming my refund and letting me know that my money will be refunded within the next 5-10 working days.

The busts are always disproportionately large, I wouldn’t say I have a particularly small chest either (C cup) and I have quite a small waist that normal clothes usually aren’t that tight on, this fits nicely around the waist however ridiculously loose around the bust.

I contacted them immediately, provided images as proof to why I would be returning. Customer service then fake apologise and said I would receive my shippings fees as soon as they receive the dress. I then returned the dress on the 21/06/21 which was the very next day after receiving it via Royal Mail. I tracked it and they had received on the 25/06/21. I contacted them on the 28 of June about my shipping fees plus my dress fees. I did receive my dress fee after a few days but have yet to receive my shipping fees. I have been contacting them ever since and each time it’s different excuse, either the bank details was incorrect or the information they had was invalid, it was always something. I have now contacted my bank and to be quite frank, I don’t take very well to dishonesty. It would be in better taste if they had said we cannot give you the shipping fee more than telling me I will receive it in 10 business days yet it’s been a whole month. Crappy service.	2021-07-26	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60fe86cff9f48709d4bf03f3	0.09785714285714285	neutral	["dress", "receive", "fees", "days", "different", "contacted", "would", "shipping", "june", "cheap"]

7929	houseofcb	Emily M	I ordered two dresses. They were expensive and I felt worried reading some of the reviews but I needn't have worried. The dresses were absolutely beautiful - better than expected in fact. The material is very heavy and they were fully lined and well-made. They arrived quickly too. I had to return one of the dresses because it didn't suit me, and I got my refund quickly (about 2 days after they received the dress back at HQ). My only gripe is no free returns. When you spend that much on a garment I would expect the company to offer free returns. Nearlly all similar companies offer this now. Fully insured return postage is at least £10 for one of their dresses (when sending via the lowest cost fully insured service), so you have to be wary of this when ordering as you could spend a lot of money returning dresses. My plea to the company is that they at least start accepting PayPal, as then customers could use the PayPal "returns on us" feature. Finally, BE CAREFUL. The people who have reviewed and said their dress came from China/took weeks to arrive/was bad quality have clearly been hoodwinked by a scam site. There are several sites that rank really high on Google that look very legitimate but are in fact counterfeit sites! House of CB should look at taking action to get these sites removed as it is very damaging to their brand.	2021-07-20	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60f6f491f9f487044c4380e5	-0.013333333333333338	neutral	["dresses", "fully", "returns", "sites", "worried", "fact", "quickly", "return", "one", "dress"]
7930	houseofcb	Samantha	My initial review was to not order from the house of cb, as I purchased a £649 wedding dress, which didn’t look quite as expected so I returned it after 2 days, unworn with tags etc, packaged as well as it was sent to me I took time checking the dress and folding it exactly how it came. I then heard nothing back on email about the return so contacted them on social. They then said they had found a mark on the sleeve of the dress. After a couple of weeks back and forth with them telling me it was with management, I finally have now been granted a refund. For a bride it’s been a worrying few weeks and my anxiety at the thought of loosing over £600 towards a dress that is actually suitable has been awful. Luckily I had pictures of the dress which showed that it did not have this mark on when I sent it back. I would advise if you order an expensive dress to take pictures of the dress every part of it and keep them so this doesn’t happen to you. I have since been advised I have been sent a full refund. So my advise isn’t to avoid this company just be careful when ordering if you decide to return ensure you check and take images of everything. I appreciate they have now kept their promise of a fair refund policy, it won’t put me off shopping with them now, I’lljust be very careful what I order in future.	2021-07-20	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60f6b2fff9f48709d4b9c1dc	0.01037037037037037	neutral	["dress", "order", "sent", "back", "refund", "return", "mark", "weeks", "pictures", "advise"]
7931	houseofcb	La Ta	I ordered a dress and I waited at least two weeks til I wrote them a message and asked them about my dress (the delivery time is 3-6 days). They would say that they had a few problems, but in a couple of days I will get my package, so I waited, but it never came. I kept asking them where my dress is, but after two months they wouldn’t even answer anymore and it´s not like that I terrorised them with messages. In the end I just wanted to have my money back, but they ignored my first request, because you can only contact them via their own website (and you don’t get any confirmation that you contacted them). I still got the email address because of my previous complaint and I said that they have to return my money within the legally prescribed time. Finally I got my money AFTER that legally prescribed time, but at least I have it now.All of this was so annoying and exhausting, I just really can’t recommend them.	2021-07-20	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60f68a83f9f487044c4306f1	-0.06777777777777778	neutral	["dress", "time", "money", "waited", "least", "two", "days", "get", "got", "legally"]
7932	houseofcb	Bethany Wilson	Sort of place where you think "wow these dresses look incredible" and then it arrives and you think "how can this dress be this bad after it looked that great online" the material looked nothing like the picture, the sizing is all over the place. The front fits but the back doesn't, the underarm section is fit so small it makes it completely unwearable.You then have to pay to send it back when it's down to a design fault and then if you buy a sale item they refuse to refund you and make you take a store credit voucher.. So you're stuck having to spend money on their website again, being out of pocket and feeling rubbish because when you try to explain the dress has poor design they then refuse fault on their part by saying the dress simply doesn't fit you and its your body that doesn't fit the dress.Each to their own and you might have had a great experience with them. This is the first review I have written on something like this and it's purely because I wish I'd read some reviews before purchasing. I was so excited to order a dress from here because they looked so lovely, but the fact they have been so difficult about this whole situation and can't even recognise when they have a fault with their products is just quite poor and disappointing. So just be careful and stay fabulous ladies 👌	2021-07-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60f5daacf9f48709d4b94720	0.12822039072039074	neutral	["dress", "looked", "doesnt", "fit", "fault", "place", "think", "great", "like", "back"]
7933	houseofcb	Ellen	I'm beyond impressed and happy with House of CB!The client service/help: I contacted House of CB per email as well as through Instagram direct message. I got very quick response in both cases (less than 24 hours) and they were extremely friendly and helpful! I had an issue (actually two) with my order (it took longer than expected and I ordered a wrong size) and they offered me an exchange of my article prior the shipping, so I haven't had to exchange it later or wait longer (bause the other article was delayed). One of the best costumer support service I ever experienced! Thank you!The dress: I ordered the Tallulah dress in olive and it's the most beautiful dress I own. Now I want it in every single colour :D The dress is worth every penny, it is very nicely made, fully lined and the fabric and shape is just out of this world. I feel like a fairy princess wearing this stunning dress! The boning is comfortable and makes the waistline nice and tiny. The chest part is double-lined too so I don`t need a bra (and it fits great even for large chest). I can only recommend it!	2021-07-15	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60f01944f9f48702a8e6033a	0.3752954931972789	positive	["dress", "house", "longer", "ordered", "exchange", "article", "every", "chest", "beyond", "impressed"]

7936	houseofcb	Kayleigh Norwood	If I could give 0 stars I would.I purchased 2 items off the website for the first time as their items looked beautiful, obviously it's not cheap but looked worth it. When purchasing I went off the size guide and measured myself. Both items arrive and both were too big which is fine even though I followed their size guide. The second thing wrong was that the top had orange spots on it. I emailed the company right away and also send the item back within hours of receiving it.The postage cost me £4.20 for signed for postage but that didn't matter as I thought I'd get that back.Once the company finally got back in touch they refused to reimburse the postage and said it wasn't possible to get my postage refund becuase it wasn't sent with marks (I'm mean sorry to burst your bubble but it was, these things happen). Honestly, the customer service was crazy and it kind of seems like they think they can do no wrong.I wanted to reorder the items in a smaller size but I now refuse to use this company again.	2021-07-11	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60eaefd7f9f48702a896b2ff	0.08449404761904764	neutral	["items", "postage", "size", "company", "looked", "guide", "back", "get", "wasnt", "could"]

So I emailed to ask when they would arrive as the wedding was at the end of that week.  House of CB couldn’t be more helpful, my order came the next day and they we’re easy to contact. I love the dress and the packaging.I’m sending one dress back as I only needed one and ordered two incase one didn’t come on time. They have already processed my refund.

7938	houseofcb	Zal Mo	Update- it has been brought to my attention by house of cb that the site I placed my order with is fake! Beware of these - I used cbstyles.com.au which is the first one that comes up when you Google house of cb. All their correspondence also lists their name as house of cb! Ridiculous! The review below is for this fake site I finally decided to splurge on these pricy dresses and pay for shipping to the Cayman Islands. Firstly- I was very annoyed to see that they shipped from CHINA. The website makes the items seem high end. It’s just cheap dresses from China.Secondly- I finally received my package a month later… only 1 dress when I ordered and PAID for 3 items! The color of the dress I received is drastically different (the website shows a pretty blush color.. in reality it’s ugly almost coral.) The quality is not what I would expect from a dress that cost more than US$100.I have seen youtube reviews of this same dress and it looked lovely just as pictured on the website so I am not sure why the one I received was so horrible! Maybe because I didn’t ship to the US?? Save your money and order from Shein.. 1/10 the price but the same quality.. Shein May even be better quality which is sadDO NOT ORDER - you will regret it! Customer service is also extremely slow to respond. I am currently waiting for a response regarding a refund for the items not received	2021-07-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60e4e7b6f9f48702a8929429	-0.05713768115942029	neutral	["received", "dress", "house", "order", "website", "items", "quality", "site", "fake", "one"]
7939	houseofcb	Elise Harvey	I honestly can't praise House of CB enough. I have made a purchase on two occasions from House of CB, and both times I have been absolutely blown away by the beauty and quality of the dresses. Without a doubt, they are the most gorgeous and high quality garments I own, both made from incredible fabric and fit absolutely perfectly. Even down to the packaging they come in, the House of CB experience is flawless.The feeling you get from wearing a House of CB dress is well worth the price. I always say to my friends that 50% of House of CB's RRPs is the dress, and 50% is the self confidence you get with it! I have struggled with body image for a while now, and no other brand makes me feel as beautiful or confident as House of CB.

7940	houseofcb	Munchkinbear	WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. I ordered a dress after I took my body measurements and carefully checked the size guide chart so the dress would fit perfectly. The size chart said the XS size had a waist of 59-65 cm and the dress was described with a 3/3 stretch factor. When I got the dress however, I couldn't even try it on with a waist of 63 cm because it was SO SMALL and it did not stretch at all. I saw other people mentioning this as well so I believe it is a reasonable claim. I reached out to customer service who just kept lying to me. I was told several times that "our dress does stretch" like I was an idiot. I asked them for a prepaid return label since the wrongful sizing is NOT the customer's responsibility but they refused to issue one. I ended up returning it on my own expense and they said they would investigate the dress, and if the sizing really isn't accurate, they would refund the price of the shipping. As you're reading this, you probably already figured out that they never reached out to me about the investigation. In addition, the refund for the dress itself was approved with a 10 business day timeframe, but 4 weeks later it still wasn't in my bank account. Additional info: the dresses come from Hong Kong but House of CB sells them for 10x the price in a fancy paper box with pink ribbon. You can find them on the famous orange-yellow logoed Chinese retail platform.	2021-07-02	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60df3c24f9f48702a88ed1d0	0.04833333333333333	neutral	["dress", "size", "would", "stretch", "customer", "service", "chart", "said", "waist", "reached"]
7941	houseofcb	Laura	I was in love with their dresses and brand for a while but never had a chance to place an order as the dresses are not cheap. Recently I received my first dress (the Faye dress in white) and was so sad that it did not zip up around the bust. I took some measurements and it turns out the dress measures 69cm around the bust however according to their website a size XS dress should measure 80-86 cm.When I contacted customer support they told me flat measurements cannot be compared to the size chart as it does not account for stretch… Ok, but the corset has no stretch at all!!!Later when I wanted to exchange the dress for another and asked if other dresses have more stretch they mentioned and I quote: “The faye dress is made from satin and that material and corseted garments in general have almost no stretch”They contradict themselves, don’t own up to their mistakes and make us pay shipping fees for their mistakes!	2021-06-29	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60dac356f9f48707ecad8d29	0.1416666666666667	neutral	["dress", "dresses", "stretch", "faye", "around", "bust", "measurements", "size", "mistakes", "love"]

7955	houseofcb	Amanda Kramer	Hey guys. It’s seems like there’s a lot of one star reviews. I’ll tell you why. This company purchases wholesale from China, false advertises quality, and then charges a 500% margin for the product that is actually only 22.00 on Ali Express. No, I’m not affiliated with Ali express at all but I’m extremely against exploiting your customers with snake oil products. I stumbled upon their products on my explorer page on Instagram and I was like “Wait a second, I know that dress.” Then I looked in my AliExpress cart and saw I had it in there for about a year. It’s also on Etsy as well for approx 50.00. Please stay away from this company until they stop robbing you. I’m also a seamstress who started making my own costumes in high school. I understand quality in terms of fabric and stitch.	2021-05-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6094a8f3f9f4870a7870f580	0.03916666666666664	neutral	["like", "company", "quality", "ali", "express", "products", "also", "hey", "guys", "seems"]

They would only issue a credit refund. Very passive on Facebook chat and failed to answer my questions and outright denying me a refund. I explained that I’d only had a baby months ago, I struggle to find anything not too revealing on their website and am on maternity pay so would really appreciate the refund. They wouldn’t because of a sentence on their website saying they won’t issue refunds for sale items. Pretty sure that’s against the law as it’s was purchased online. Will contact trading standards about this.Didn’t care an ounce! Typical reply, that they’ve probably sent to hundreds others. Very poor service. Never want to buy from the again and will advise others not to, as well.	2021-05-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6094317af9f4870a7870addb	0.04935185185185184	neutral	["refund", "purchased", "top", "sale", "still", "fit", "sent", "would", "issue", "website"]

I brought a dress from them online however I wore it once and it was faulty. I had sent it back within the 14 days return period and they refused to give me a refund! they only offered me a repair. they dragged it on for over a month refusing to refund me considering I was well within my statutory rights to get a refund. their professionalism and  communication was extremely poor and the quality of their garments is appalling considering the price!  If like me you were refused a refund for an item please do contact your bank for a reverse charge.	2021-05-01	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/608d1082f9f487047414bbcc	-0.28958333333333336	negative	["refund", "avoid", "within", "refused", "considering", "could", "put", "stars", "would", "far"]
7959	houseofcb	Willow	While yes, the material is very good and the dress fits nicely, I also was very disappointed in the communication and information provided by the website. First off:Either I'm blind or I haven't even been asked in which packaging I'd like to receive the dress...Second off: when it got to me I was rather disappointed that the tull lining in the sleeve, was not even there (it especially points out the lining on the site)Third off: while the site is pointing out it is supposedly a linen dress, on the tag in the dress itself it says 100% polyester.... Now, the material does not feel like polyester and if it is then it must be a very expensive polyester. (on the site they say the tull lining is of polyester and the dress is a linen and cotton blend, so I believe something got mixed up, but still....)So as a result, all I can say is, buy with caution.	2021-04-24	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60840e22f9f487093ccd5c7a	-0.12388888888888891	negative	["dress", "polyester", "lining", "material", "disappointed", "even", "like", "got", "tull", "site"]

Despite my dress taking 11 days to get to me I was only given two days to return it, I had to buy shipping and only received a gift card in exchange.	2021-04-22	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6081bd51f9f48701fc7acb25	-0.25	negative	["dress", "days", "get", "see", "ordered", "took", "arrived", "shocked", "quality", "thin"]

7967	houseofcb	Eleni	I honestly don’t understand the bad reviews. I ordered a dress (shipped to Italy) and it looked like in the pictures plus it arrived on time. The size fits me (I’m 175 tall and got an M) but i feel like the last part of the dress is a little bit tight but a bigger size would’ve been too large for the rest of my body (I have to precise I have quite skinny legs so that wasn’t the issue about the size of the dress, the material just isn’t elastic enough to allow to move the legs comfortably).Concluding, I’m pretty satisfied with the order, even though the reviews scared me a lot.	2021-03-29	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6061fac8f85d7508703c0b9f	0.08165584415584416	neutral	["dress", "size", "reviews", "like", "legs", "honestly", "understand", "bad", "ordered", "shipped"]

Not only do you get high quality clothing, top fashion styles with beautiful packaging at such an affordable price but you also get customer services that comes from the fashion gods above!! I have this bad habit of ordering stuff in the middle of the night while being half asleep and forgetting what I order the next day. I lost track of my orders and what I had purchased last month. Thinking that I had received my complete orders I got a couple of friendly emails from HouseofCB stating that I had not received some of products and they apologize for the delay on some items. I was astonished right away on how organized the business is and how much they pay attention to each order. Wow HouseofCB you truly make me feel like I’m worth a million bucks not only by wearing beautiful clothing but by having beyond the five star experience.

They emailed me asking if i wanted a refund or i wanted to exchange for another dress as they did not know when their dresses are being restocked and I picked another dress. this dress was also not in stock anymore but still on the website so I therefore asked for a refund. and then they stocked the dress again and asked if i wanted it or if i wanted a refund. Customer experience would be much easier and smoother if they just sorted out their website and knew when their stock was being restocked.	2021-03-18	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60539197f85d7509fc0f8b37	0.2	neutral	["wanted", "dress", "stock", "website", "refund", "another", "restocked", "asked", "buy", "18th"]

7971	houseofcb	mi	This review is solely based on the sizing, the customer service, and the fact that you have to pay for your return at House of CB. I ordered the Jolanda dress in both a size Medium (M) and Large (L) and neither of them fit lol :(. The medium was slightly too small around my bust/chest area and the large was way too big around the bust/chest and hip area. I have reason to believe that their size chart is not accurate because my measurements should fit a medium. Just for reference, I usually wear a size 4/6 in U.S. and my measurements are in the middle of the small and medium sizes on the House of CB size chart. Additionally, when I received the dress in Large, it came smelling like chemicals and sweat. When I told House of CB of this incident, they said to return it to them, and they will only reimburse me for the postage if it is found to be a manufacturing error. I also asked if they have any suggestions about altering/"taking in" the Large size dress since it was too big for me, and they said they don't recommend altering it and continued to urge me to send them back the dress. Although I am so disappointed that I can't support this business just because it seems like nothing will fit me from there, I still love their designs and hope that the sizing will be more inclusive and accurate in the future.	2021-02-23	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60354eb0f85d7509d8e24418	0.06835317460317461	neutral	["size", "dress", "medium", "large", "house", "fit", "sizing", "return", "small", "around"]

The fabric is flattering [my dress fits like a glove!], clings to my curves and looks identical to online, which is very rare. The order process was straightforward and communication was fantastic.

7973	houseofcb	Frances Aigbugui	I am a 40 year old female and after birthing 3 kids, I tended to not feel as confident as I used to. I have previously bought a pair of the Paris heels and a Brianne dress from House of CB and that was 2 years and a year ago respectively. I needed a dress for my 15 years wedding vow renewal and I had my eye on the Talya toffee corset midi dress. I placed my order and shipping to Canada was in 5 business days and was super fast! I  have always been an XS and I was not sure if I would still fit an XS, and I have small perky boobs😊 and so I was very self conscious about how I would look in that dress but I desperately wanted to celebrate my vow renewal in it and so I resorted in chatting with the customer care of House of CB on both Facebook and direct messaging on Insta and let me tell you, each time I asked questions they always responded and not just that it's how they did respond. They had no idea about how much worry  and anxiety I was feeling at each point but they always made me feel alot better about myself. They asked me questions about my size and measurements and they gave me useful advice about finding someone to help zip me into the dress as it has a built in corset( and that was something new to me as I had never owned or worn a corset in my life before now). I was finally able to get my husband to help out with getting into the dress(even though I didn't want him seeing my dress until our ceremony in Mar) but due to the present world pandemic I couldn't ask any of my girlfriends to come over. The dress fit me beautifully and I cannot wait to get dolled up for my anniversary. I plan on buying more items from them moving forward and I will definitely recommend to my work colleagues and family. 💕💕💕	2021-02-20	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60316092f85d750b989b9b94	0.1591212121212121	neutral	["dress", "corset", "always", "year", "feel", "house", "years", "vow", "renewal", "would"]
7974	houseofcb	TrustPilot92	Houseofcb is by far my favourite brand. If it's not Houseofcb, it's not in my wardrobe! There is no fit or quality like the fit and quality of a houseofcb garment.  The fabrics are always so heavy I've never seen any other brands with this kind of quality. Not only are they the best for how nice the clothes hug your figure but also for how it makes you feel. I still remember the very first houseofcb item I ever got... the Sophina Snake print leggings all those years agoCompared to other brands, the customer service team are amazing, friendly and helpful and always respond so quickly. You can contact them on Instagram, email and I think facebook. Each platform is equally as fast and helpful :)In the past I have asked questions relating to houseofcb product on Conna Walker's instagram posts, and she always replies. It's rare for a founder to take such an active role in interacting with customers and just another reason why I love the brand because she genuinely cares about customers. I am relocating to Dubai for a new job opportunity and I bought a whole new work wardrobe from houseofcb (+ summer clothes lol). There is no other brand which I'd want to wear on my first day where I need to be feeling confident and looking my best!Work outfits, valentines outfits, vaycay outfits, brunch outfits, wedding outfits... dinner outfits.. basically outfits for all occasions! Finally, I'm mixed race so when I read how houseofcb was donating some of its profits to support the BLM movement (during a pandemic which obviously impacted retailers) it just cemented even more why it's my favourite brand. I will forever support this brand! xx	2021-02-19	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/60303c58f85d7509d8dea230	0.25188210227272734	neutral	["houseofcb", "outfits", "brand", "quality", "always", "favourite", "wardrobe", "fit", "brands", "clothes"]

7977	houseofcb	Marta M.	The clothing is truly beautiful, very unique, statement pieces. However, the sizing could be more consistent (I'm an XS, however some 3/3 stretch dresses fit me much tighter than those labeled 1/3; same with corsets, they fit ever so slightly larger or smaller than others I have in same size). Another thing, on almost all of my mesh dresses, the little hook and eye closures at the top have come undone and I've had to redo them myself, which I really don't want to be doing on a 100+ £ dress. Please stitch those more securely. Other than that, the dresses are truly stunning and the materials are of great quality. xx	2021-02-10	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/602437b8679d9708b4d21c9c	0.2930555555555555	neutral	["dresses", "truly", "however", "fit", "clothing", "beautiful", "unique", "statement", "pieces", "sizing"]

7984	houseofcb	Araceli Alvarez	Honestly was super excited to get a dress from House of CB since I saw so many cute reviews on Youtube.

When I received the dresses they were beautiful however they both ran extremely small. I couldn't even get my head through the openings. I got large in one of the dresses and so no point in ordering an exchange since there isn't a larger size.

I purchased the Ivory Selena dress, when the dress came I opened the box only to find the dress was heavily creased in the middle area, I thought ok it should just straighten out once I wear the dress, but on closer inspection the stitching was coming apart but ever so slight, so I went to try the dress on I noticed the zip was not all the way closed but I didn’t think any more of it, once I put the dress on I asked my husband to zip me up, but the zip would not fully close, so I emailed customer services, and they said I should send the dress back and make sure it’s sent with a tracking number which I did, and email a photo of the receipt and they would refund the delivery cost once they have inspected the dress. When they did get the dress back all I got was a refund for the dress no refund for my delivery cost. I emailed them once again to ask about my return cost, they then told me a fault wasn’t found so I’m not entitled to a refund of my delivery cost. What a total scam of a company. PLEASE DO NOT ORDER FROM THEIR ONLINE STORE, AS YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF RETURNS EVEN IF THE FAULT IS WITH THIER QUALITY OF STOCK.	2021-01-20	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/600833ec755dc104c0c36071	-0.05476190476190475	neutral	["dress", "refund", "cost", "zip", "delivery", "customer", "would", "emailed", "back", "fault"]
7989	houseofcb	Sophie Lauren	Anyone thinking of ordering from this well presented & socially marketed company please DONT ! Especially during Covid as they’re clearly desperate for sales so they can continue to pay their social media influencers.I purchased two dresses - costing a whopping £300 for New Year’s Eve. Only one arrived in time and it became immediately apparent this dress ran very small, as I couldn’t even put my arms through the sleeve so the dress was immediately placed back in the box and left. All labels and security rope intact. The second dress then arrived a week later despite 2-3 day delivery garunteed. This dress wasn’t even unboxed ! At the point it was A. Too late and B. I knew it was unlikely to fit so both dresses were returned. Now this is the part I’d like everyone to be careful of ordering as you will be paying a fortune to return these dresses by guaranteed post as they will claim they never received them back if you don’t !! So I paid £24 to post these !!! Yes £24 lost down the drain. The worst part came when a week later I still had no notification that my dresses had been received ! This was strange as every other company sends a confirmation email upon receipt of a return.... not this one ! I had to email to ask why, my answer ! Wait for this !!!!! ... hello sophie we have received your dresses however they’re with management as both are soiled !!” Honestly the upset and disgust I feel towards this absolute fraud of a company goes beyond words ! Willing to steal and lie to keep money in a pandemic when everyone is on the bread line !! I have now contacted bbc as this deserves some publicity and media coverage and submitted all my evidence and correspondence and also my credit card company. I will also be contacting trading standards . I’m not letting this drop I’m so shocked and disgusted. I want them exposed !!	2021-01-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/600684b0755dc10a4064e6d9	-0.139255166437311	negative	["dresses", "company", "dress", "received", "ordering", "media", "one", "arrived", "immediately", "even"]

7991	houseofcb	Alex Johnson	So, I ordered a dress for my reunion special on a show called “Ready to Love” on the Oprah Winfrey Network. My dress was a size too big and I was FREAKING out (to say the least) because we were filming the reunion like a week from the time I tried on my dress. I reached out to their customer service, and they responded quickly with detailed instructions to assist me in trying to get a smaller size before my reunion. I followed their instructions and received my dress within a day of filming! Whew, to say I am appreciate is an understatement! Thank you so much for helping little ole me! It meant everything and one less thing I had to stress out about (because I also had a hair dilemma as well, hehe)!If I could give 6 starts I would. You have a lifetime customer in me. Thank you, thank you, thank you! P.S. The new dress fit perfectly!

The process of exchanging was very effortless and the online customer service was very helpful and prompt when replying to emails concerning my exchange and delivery.

7998	houseofcb	Danielle Mills	The customer service is awful. The Celine cardigan I bought started falling apart after two months and I was subsequently palmed off by customer service who refused to compensate the faulty item in any way. The best I was offered was for the garment to be ‘looked at’ if I paid p&p to send it back to their warehouses with no guarantee any refund or exchange would be received. Somehow this company has enough funds to pay influencers extortionate fees in order to promote the brand yet have a history of bad customer service and tend to refuse refunds and returns to paying customers.

8015	houseofcb	RA	House of Cb have not only gone down hill over the years but are also the biggest scammers. It’s as if they style for Middle Aged woman now. The clothes are unfashionable, unstylish and of bad quality. If you ever return something back because of the awful quality they will not refund you the money you are entitled too they will give you a gift code instead so that you can spend more money on their website. I have been emailing them for months on end to give me back my money due to their insufficient quality and they have refused every time, I gave up the end, now I am left with a gift code I will never use, I am disgusted by their behaviour in quality standards and customer service. Absolute money pinchers they are a disgrace to the fashion industry. Never buy from their company I can assure you it’s not worth any penny. I wouldn’t even give them a star. Everything they’re doing breaches the consumer rights act I wouldn’t half be tempted to report them to watchdog, they are not a legitimate business and shouldn’t be trusted.	2020-11-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5fbce4cf5e693f08f0087e19	-0.17981481481481476	negative	["quality", "money", "give", "back", "gift", "code", "end", "never", "house", "gone"]

Just shipped the item and left it outside my House. In a global pandemic this is a disgrace. The value is for £650. Do NOT use them please they are a complete scam. I ensured the item was in perfect condition- ensured their pink tag wasn’t damaged at all. Packaged all back up. So this is a disgrace.

I emailed them saying that I want to return it because my event was that weekend and i wouldn't have enough time for an exchange so i just wanted my money back and a reimbursement of my shipping fees ( since it was their fault the button was missing, i even provided photos). They assured me that the shipping fees would be reimbursed in full if I provided a receipt. I went and shipped the dress back (it cost me $40 from Philadelphia to California) and sent them the receipt and they did not get my money back for the shipping costs. They confirmed they got the receipt but ignored evert one of my emails after that.

8023	houseofcb	Mechelle	This Review was originally posted on Google Reviews verbatim.Let me start my review by saying that all of the staff I dealt with were lovely, professional at all times and helpful.I purchased a long black chenille cardigan some time ago £60 (I cannot recall when exactly when and I no longer have the receipt to hand). Due to the material I decided to keep it in the box. The first time I wore the cardigan I noticed that there were a few pulls/snags after I wore it but thought that I might have caught it inadvertently so resigned to be more careful. I wore it a second time and noticed more pulls/snags, I thought about returning it but I love the cardigan so kept it.About 14 days ago I was in House of CB and while queuing to pay a woman came in with the same cardigan in cream, it was discoloured and she claimed to have "washed it once by hand and dried it flat". I do not know if what she said was true but the cardigan was tatty with lots of snags/pulls which alarmed me as I had visions of my cardigan in the future, albeit black.I then started to notice other women wearing the same/similar cardigans so began approaching them and engaging them in conversation about the cardigan. My opening comment was to compliment the cardigan then ask where it was from?... the response on each occasion was it's from House of CB and is a lovely garment but....then they all pointed out the issue of the snags/pulls.This commonality made me realise that it was a design fault... I had worn my cardigan on no more than 4 occasions so today reluctantly took it back to House of CB to have a discussion....I accept that I do not have my receipt (I may have paid cash but will check my bank statements) however there is clearly a design fault at play here and were it an electrical item the company would have recalled it recognising that it it a fault with the item.The staff acknowledged that my cardigan was in mint condition, in the tissue it came with, in the box and were happy to return it to the warehouse/head office; however I did not have the receipt. It was also acknowledged that mine was not the first cardigan that had been returned with this problem. How many people keep clothing receipts indefinitely???I have kindly been provided with details of their customer service department and will update this review as to my progress in due course. I will say that were this certain other stores receipt or not there would have been no quibbles on an exchange or refund.Thanks again to the staff at House of CB Stratford for their empathy and excellent customer service. Love the dress I bought today though 😍.The pictures don't show all of the flaws clearly but give a general idea of the issue.UPDATE 22/10/2020... surprisingly after 9 months I found the receipt for my cardigan so have today returned it to the House of CB Store, Westfield, Stratford. As always I found the staff to be really professional and helpful. My cardigan is now on its way to wherever their returns go. Given that the item is faulty I have requested a refund (although I love the cardigan I am concerned that the problem will reoccur) so... I await a response from House of CB and will update this feed in due course.UPDATE 31/10/2020 ...the promised update.. HoCB have replaced my Chenile cardigan no questions asked which is pretty impressive given that I had purchased it over 9 months ago (at the point of return). However, while I'm pleased with their customer service and the cardigan. I'm left with a garment which I'm now terrified to wear as, if, as I suspect, it's a design fault I'm going to eventually be in the same situation with an expensive cardigan that very quickly looks tatty. It took me 9 months to wear it 3 or 4 times if it takes me another 9 months to wear it 3/4 times and it is damaged I cannot keep returning it and as I stated when I returned it I would rather have had a cash refund.Nevertheless Thank you HoCB 😊 for replacing my cardigan.	2020-11-02	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f9ffd2d5e693f06a0036ffa	0.20220734126984122	neutral	["cardigan", "house", "receipt", "staff", "fault", "months", "review", "times", "time", "ago"]

Once you have bought the item and if it is faulty, or you have a problem with the item, they don't care. The lady refused to help and started to become very rude. This cardigan starts to fall apart after a few uses. DO NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY!

Not only was shipping free it arrived in two days! I was not stressed or anxious about receiving it on time. When it arrived let’s talk about the details! The packaging screamed luxury! The quality of the top it self was the cherry on top! This top will be a favorite and staple in my closet for years.

8040	houseofcb	haz shaniqua	DO NOT BUY A HOUSE OF CB WEDDING DRESS! This company are scumbags who refuse to accept returns by falsely claiming they are marked. I thoroughly checked the dress before sending it back (postage cost over £30) then 2 weeks later I received a House of CB box with the dress in but no paper work, no tissue, nothing. I contacted the company and they said there was a mark on the dress and therefore they can't accept the return. There isn't. I see that other people have had the same problem (see Hayley's review below). Please, please, please do not buy a dress (especially a wedding dress) from House of CB- they will refuse you your basic consumer rights.

I bought the chenille ‘Celine’ cardigan in the grey color last year and if you want to basically throw away $100, then definitely buy that cardigan. I’ve been wanting to leave a review about my experience/purchase but you can’t write a review on the store website (wonder why). Anyway, It instantly started to pill so bad that it was embarrassing to be seen in it in public. I basically have to knit the cardigan back together after ever use. I reached out to customer service with someone named Noel(le?) and I was asked for pictures BUT only then they would still have to ‘review’ the pictures to evaluate whether or not it was eligible for return/exchange. Not only that but I would have to pay for shipping it back.

8043	houseofcb	Erin Burns	I received a partial refund for my returned items and when I queried this, I was told my item had been “referred to management as it had signs of being altered/tailored.” The jeans in question were returned a day after being delivered as they were too small and too short. Returned in the same way they were sent.Why would I go to the lengths of paying to have an item tailored and then have to pay to return said item? It’s ludicrous! If you ask me, it’s a way of getting out of sending me a full refund. On top of this, I was not informed in any way of this and had to chase this up myself. Very, very disappointed and put off from ordering again.

Luckily they refunded me for the post. 2 weeks later I received the replacement and it was again faulty.

I asked to exchange the size because there is no way to wear the top and was told that it was just too bad and I would have to keep it. $100 and two months later I can say that I’m sorely disappointed with this company’s customer service and would not recommend that anyone buy something from here unless you would like to waste your time and money.	2020-09-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f6c6b4c798e6f09601ed0cb	-0.05826446280991735	neutral	["new", "would", "asked", "exchange", "top", "size", "told", "shipped", "different", "sold"]

8057	houseofcb	M Adelasoye	All the bad reviews you hear about nightmare experiences with Refunds/exchanges with this company  are true. Because of the high prices and thick material of the products, you would believe you’re paying for quality and similar service - and you would be wrong. I have taken my time out to spare others of my Shocking experience and am genuinely surprised the company hasn’t gone into administration yet in this customer centric age, but I’ll try and be conscise.I bought a £140 white jumpsuit for a work Xmas party with a deep neckline open back Fixed with a metal gold clasp. I purchased this at their Stratford  London store, and the shop floor version (which  you are allowed to try on) already had this clasp broken. Little did I know this was a sign of a manufacturing fault, as I just assumed because many people would have tried on this version the clasp would have been broken. The first time I wore the jumpsuit at my Xmas party the clasp indeed broke on the dance floor exposing my chest. My female colleagues ran to my aid and tied the loose the strings the clasp was attached to into a knot so I could make it through the night. To get out of that Bodycon jumpsuit that night I then had to peel myself out of the thing, leaving excess staining. The next day I went to the store to complain and get a replacement item if they had one (as I loved the item) or a refund.I was made to fill in a form for “investigation”. Long story short, after weeks of numerous emails and poor fobbing responses, they replaced the broken clasp but returned back the heavily stained item with a letter that “they were unable to remove the stains”. I can tell you no attempt to clean that item was made despite it not being my fault and the complaints which were made.So in summary once houseofcb take your money just know you are on your own. Avoid this company like the plague, just look at their Twitter reviews as evidence - I wish I did!	2020-08-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f361c489cc22a0600cb656c	-0.05568958818958818	neutral	["clasp", "would", "item", "company", "jumpsuit", "broken", "reviews", "time", "try", "xmas"]

8059	houseofcb	Nicola	I ordered from the site back in June, received the dress I purchased nicely packaged and quite promptly, especially considering the situation with Covid. Though beautiful, the style and size didn't work for me, so I returned the item for a refund. Here's where the issues started: the return policy is antiquated (had to pay for shipping back to the company and at this point, most competitors pay for return shipping), and secondly, almost two months later, I still have not received my refund. After corresponding twice with customer service, both times they claimed they issued my refund and that it takes up to ten business days to post, I still haven't received a credit to my account over TWENTY business days later. It is now my headache to work out with my bank to get my money back. Despite the desirable product and decent quality for the price, I will not return here for business. There are too many other premium competitors with similar product, better customer service, shipping, and refund policies.	2020-08-07	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f2d94f81a5a690268453434	0.18697916666666667	neutral	["refund", "back", "received", "return", "shipping", "business", "work", "pay", "competitors", "later"]
8060	houseofcb	Holly	no confirmation email, spent over $550 and only got an email when i publicly reached out. sent the items back for a refund as the sizing was WAY off, and am now having to chase up my refund. nothing confirming i sent the items back, which was about a month ago. really shocking customer service (and garment quality!) for such a huge price tag. made overseas, so no need to be so expensive. very sad, dresses looked so pretty :(	2020-08-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f2b3d7c1a5a690a04209cde	-0.19583333333333333	negative	["email", "sent", "items", "back", "refund", "confirmation", "spent", "550", "got", "publicly"]
8061	houseofcb	Daniela Blazevska	Never buying from this company again! Reed this about their   return policy   before thinking about ordering from this brand!!! When you buy the clothing , have in mind that if it doesn’t fit only to return it will cost you     more than $30   since their box weighs more than the clothing you buy!!Also they don’t offer a free return which to me is ridiculous after you buy a dress that costs you $200 and don’t have a store available to see or try on the item.I personally don’t feel comfortable ordering and buying from this company, nobody want to pay extra expenses for a return or exchange of an item. If you don’t offer a free return and expect the costumers to pay their own, don’t try to be all fancy and make the delivery in a box that weighs double the clothing.	2020-08-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f2a45911a5a6907a47ae852	0.2512820512820513	neutral	["return", "clothing", "buying", "company", "ordering", "buy", "box", "weighs", "offer", "free"]

After having to remind them that they have failed on their contract with me, they made me sign a document that said they would contact the police if I had lied about parcel force not delivering my item and asked for proof of identification via my passport details and photo ID. PAHAHAHAHA ... I mean what the actual hell ? Then they blocked me on instgram, obviously because they cant have other non suspecting customers complain about there illegal trading can they.

UPS had miss placed my package and house of CB team (Mia) Helped me effortlessly to help me track the package. They’ve emailed me every day to follow up until I finally found the package and I was very happy.  Thank you House of CB team for your excellent customer service.

8069	houseofcb	Katy Dixon	DO NOT BUY FROM HOUSE OF CBFirstly I bought a sale item - don’t do this as you don’t get a refund! They only give a gift card. I originally returned the dress with a note to ask for an exchange for the next size up. After deciding this would be too slow I emailed after I sent the parcel back in the post to say I’d re-purchased the dress so it would arrive quicker and could I be refunded instead - she said sure no problem! Great I thought. New dress in the next size up arrives - still doesn’t fit right (their sizing is literally the least accurate I’ve ever come across!) so have returned it also. Now I’ve ended up with two gift cards for the amount spent, lost out on postage cost (they don’t don’t do free returns) And have had my emails ignored asking why this has happened. It’s not clear in the slightest that the sale items are none refundable and what’s worse is that the lady I originally spoke to told me it was fine and I would be refunded which I clearly haven’t been. Utter joke and completely outdated customer service. Really angry and upset - feel like I’ve wasted £100’s of pounds and not got anything for it. Also nervous to buy again as the sizing is so inaccurate I’d no doubt have to return the item again. Please don’t shop here, it’s been an awful experience.	2020-07-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f0f4e083f06f20bb4b359bd	0.04654978354978354	neutral	["dress", "would", "buy", "sale", "item", "gift", "originally", "returned", "next", "size"]

Sent an image to house of cb who said to send the cardigan back and they would investigate. They came back to me and said I was not allowed a refund because the item had been worn (I had worn it twice and owned it for less than a week) Adamant that they won’t give me a refund and instead would give me a gift card which I do not want.You expect more when you pay near enough £60 for a cardigan!!I would also like to add I have since started a chargeback claim with my bank to get the money back. House of CB have denied the claim so it is being investigated further. Also, look how many bad reviews there are for the Celine cardigan! It’s not just my problem!

The cheap corset had metallic zipper, it was white with  threads coming out. The worst. THEY ARE SCAMMERS. If you notice that the quality or look differs from their website it’s because they have properly sent you a DUPE or cheaper version. HOUSE OF CB NEEDS TO BE REPORTED. They are scammers.I bought it from your website:Houseofcb.com (this website won’t let me copy/paste the web address) And have screen shot of the order from your website. Fake house of cb website??do tell;  Expose the fake house of cb websites. You’re the worst. Just give me my refund back and I will Gladly send you back your “corset”.LATEST UPDATE: house of cb never got in touch with me but PayPal won me my money back from them. So there you have it. I’m happy it got resolved. I’ve been buying online since I was 16 so yeah- there is no such things as FAKE house of cb websites.

8086	houseofcb	Charlotte Dimitrov	I don't usually write negative reviews on products but I am just shocked at the faults in this product, a product that I thought would be good quality given the price! I recently bought a cardigan from House of CB, the Celine cardigan in white/cream. I was so excited to purchase this cardigan after wanting it for many months and I finally took the plunge to buy it but I wish I had not now. For 59 pounds, I was expecting an excellent quality cardigan that would last me years and years. On the first occasion of wearing it, it started to pull and unravel, initially I thought I was doing something wrong but on the second occasion I wore it for about 2 hours, it completely pulled and unraveled on the pockets and all the way down the back of the cardigan. This should not be happening from wearing a cardigan for two hours and sitting in your car, it is clearly faulty. I dread to think what would happen to it if I washed it. The quality is not what I expected and I now have a cardigan that I can't wear as it is so damaged, 59 pounds down the drain! I reached out to House of CB and they said that I would need to send the parcel back for inspection (as if I was lying), but they would not cover the costs of delivery back (but may cover it at a later date up to £20), however, I have not had the time to send it back and I find it a hassle that I have to pay for an item to be sent back when it is through no fault of my own, I did not ask for a damaged product so it has really put a downer on my experience of buying from House of CB. I sent many images to the House of CB but they still insisted they wanted to to post the parcel back at a cost to myself with no guarantee of a refund or them covering my postage costs. It is a very heavy item and will cost me alot of money to send back, money which I have no guarantee of getting back may I add!!! I find it all abit of a bad experience and wish it had been different as I initially wanted the cardigan in every color!	2020-06-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ef214557dd753032473e0f9	0.03828571428571429	neutral	["cardigan", "back", "would", "house", "product", "quality", "send", "thought", "many", "wish"]

8089	houseofcb	Natali P. Thomas	I honestly don't know how anyone can purchase online from HouseofCB. You have to go in-store because the sizing is completely off. I ordered an XS based on the size chart and it was literally 10 inches smaller in the bust and approximately 6 inches smaller in the waist. I messaged HCB on FaceBook and was told to ship it back, pay for shipping, and they would refund me the shipping. Turns out the sizing was off so they issued me a refund for the top, but gave me a $9 STORE CREDIT - ONLINE ONLY for the shipping (that's how much it cost me). So I tried again, ordering a bodysuit in M based on the prior XS being so small. Well, that bodysuit was a true size M, honestly maybe even bigger. So now that didn't fit and I messaged HCB and was told all they could do was give store credit this time. The packaging was great. But on top of all this, I see the item shipped from the Phillippines and appears to have been made in Hong Kong. I went back to look at the first purchase and that too came from Hong Kong. Here I am thinking I'm buying from a London Boutique - wrong. I am usually hopeful with online purchases and disregard reviews like the one I am posting, but if you're buying online, best of luck getting something that's accurately sized. The quality is great but what's the point if it doesn't fit.	2020-06-16	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ee8edf77dd7530828c29105	0.22000000000000003	neutral	["online", "shipping", "honestly", "purchase", "sizing", "based", "size", "inches", "smaller", "messaged"]

8097	houseofcb	Cristina López Martín	In the beginning of April I bought a bodysuit in the size XS (I measured myself and even asked to the special “service” they have for that). When it arrived (took 20 days to arrive to Barcelona) it was too tight on me, so I payed around 10€ to change it for an S. It arrived in less than a week but took around three or four days for them to process the change, so when they finally got to it there was no more stock. Because of this they gave me a giftcard, but I did not want a giftcard, I wanted my money back, I did not like anything appart from the bodysuit and if I wanted to buy something else in their store that should be my decision, not theirs.They told me that if an article is on sale they cannot return the money but a giftcard. This is not legal either in Europe nor in UK and I told them so, even sent them some links with information about the UK law, but different people kept saying the same: ‘we can only give you a giftcard’.I got tired so I started a litigation in the european platform. They, as a company, have 90 days to answer (they still did not).While I wait for the resolution of the litigation I sometimes check if there is a size S again, just in case. Yesterday night I was really surprised when I saw there was stock again, so I tried to purchase it with my gift card... Man, even that they do it wrong. I added the bodysuit to my basket and applied the giftcard, everything looks ok, it says “0€”. I put my adress and everything and then they ask for my credit card (weird because I had nothing to pay for) I put it and when I click “pay” it gives me an error: “The amount is not correct, it should be bigger than zero”. I tried in different devices and browsers but it was not that.By that time I just thought they were laughing at my face.I wrote an email but by the time they answered (they said I should pay my order and then send an email again with the code so they could cancel the payment) there was no stock again and I still have a useless giftcard.I just want to say again that it is ILLEGAL what they are doing. If a customer buys something online they have the right to get their money back if they return it within 14 days (which is my case).	2020-06-05	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5eda56bf25e5d209b8fdc728	-0.0841991341991342	neutral	["giftcard", "days", "bodysuit", "even", "stock", "money", "pay", "size", "arrived", "took"]

8118	houseofcb	Qian Marquard	First time shopper but I'm pleasantly surprised.A few things:1) Design: Ultra sexy and unique, especially the bikinis and lounge wear. 2) Shipping was fast3) Return was relatively easy- I live in Singapore, shipping to everywhere out of this region takes long and is expensive (Biggest problem for me re-online shopping here). Happy to learn that KL Malaysia is where I can send back to instead of the UK. 4) Packaging- The most luxurious packaging for online shopping so far. The items came in a beautiful box, individually wrapped nicely. Kind of Neiman Marcus style. To me, it shows how much they take pride in their products and makes me feel I've done some high-end shopping (from home). Would be awesome for gifting too!My take on sizing:I wear US size  2-4, UK 8, they all translate to XS outside of Asia, but XS from House of CB was way too small (Guess if the fabric was a bit more stretchy, it would have been ok) So, maybe go with the bigger end of your range?Okay. Anything they could do better...?Fabric. Fabric is the biggest problem for me. Had to return a couple because of the fabric. It didn't do the justice of the design- One dress looks a little cheap in person.Fabric that not stretchy- Somehow you feel it might be more stretchy in the pictures than it actually is.  Over all, I am happy with House of CB and will definitely be back for more.	2020-04-18	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e9ad740086b6409bc876acc	0.27388807429130013	neutral	["shopping", "fabric", "stretchy", "design", "wear", "shipping", "return", "biggest", "problem", "happy"]

8119	houseofcb	I.Y	I love house of CB clothes but the reason i gave it 4 stars is that I think they need to make corset dresses and tops according to boob size. Because most of their tops are corset, some people have big boobs and are really small in body size, so sometimes they don’t really get a perfect fit. I got a really nice corset top from house of CB and the boobs part was okay but because I bought it in a size medium due to having big boobs , the sleeves of the top is very loose and keeps falling off because my overall body is size small. So I think they should consider having different corset sizes while considering that there are people who have these problems with big boobs and a small  body shape	2020-04-17	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e998123086b6409bc869bb5	0.1960526315789474	neutral	["corset", "size", "boobs", "big", "really", "small", "body", "house", "think", "tops"]

8121	houseofcb	Elizabeth Varley	I purchased a dress from them at the end of 2019. I have numerous other pieces from the brand and have, until now, held them in high regard. I wore the dress once and washed it as per their care label. The dress shrunk meaning my private body parts were exposed as the dress now only to my hips. I returned the dress to them and they sent it back to be covered in black dust marks as though it had been dragged across a shop floor staying there was nothing they could do. I sent photos of myself in the dress when I purchased it where it fit fin, and after when it was distorted and shrunken. They had no interest in this and two months on they persist on ignoring my emails and refusing to help me. This is still ongoing.Over the corse of my dealings with them they have used the excuse of having a small team as to why it has took 8 weeks for them to give me an outcome (and they still haven't) yet I have dealt with 8 different people all of whom offered no solution.For a brand who prides themselves on high quality and luxury the treatment I have received is appalling. I am left will an obsolete £129 dress which I cannot even re-sell as I would be embarrassed to give this to someone - a feeling they clearly do not posses.I would not purchase from them again and would encourage anyone who asked me for thoughts on the brand to do they same.	2020-04-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e973574086b6409bc8530ac	-0.016979166666666663	neutral	["dress", "brand", "would", "purchased", "high", "sent", "still", "give", "end", "2019"]

Three days later, I looked on usps tracking and it was returned and signed for by an house of cb employee, so I tossed the receipt.Two weeks passed and I hadn’t received a refund so I emailed them. They indicated they never received the return, even after I told them it was signed for. I went to the post office and begged them to pull up all the transactions from that day . I sent house of cb a copy of the proof of return and their employees signature. A week later I received a refund, no apology or anything. Had I not found the info from usps, I would’ve been out of over $200 and they’d be $200 richer, and have the dress back. To make matters worse, usps only keeps records for 30 days, so I’m grateful I went on the 27th day, and it was still in their system.	2020-03-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e7e43cc3c93ae06dc6afdcd	-0.07142857142857142	neutral	["return", "signed", "usps", "received", "returned", "dress", "even", "days", "later", "house"]

I have ordered from this site in the past and had issues but I have to say they have really upped their customer service and quality of their garments. This is now becoming my favorite boutique to shop at. They listen to their customers and provide the things we want as consumers which is great to have in a company it shows they care about us. I made another purchase last night and cannot wait to receive it. Overall they are becoming a trusted brand for me and I look forward to buying more from this shop.	2020-03-24	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e7a04a43c93ae09180ddcb7	0.3230769230769231	positive	["great", "ordered", "quality", "becoming", "shop", "recently", "experience", "house", "item", "birthday"]

8139	houseofcb	goldblonde	Complaints can be sent to a manager keep asking for the managers email address, Trustpilot don't allow me to put email address on here so pursue House of CB for itI was sold a faulty dress very poor stitching for the money, you get better at primark. Under The Sale of Goods Act HOUSE OF CB have a duty to refund my money for faulty goods this is the law. Two weeks after it was returned as faulty they refused to refund the money as they alleged it had marks on???? Very funny that I have asked to see what the Managers report about the poor quality dress many times but all ignored, by some of them very rude staff. I have asked for a deadlock letter to no avail. I have also asked for customer service to tell me  the price of the dress and how it was paid for?All ignored, which seems to be the treatment of people being sold these poor quality faulty dresses. This is unlawful. Dont buy from them. Report them via Resolver who are keeping tracking complaints on their shame list so people know which companies to check and avoid. go to the Small Claims Court or your credit card company as they cannot be allowed to continue getting away with this from the many many peoples reviews over the internet who are being unlawfully denied refunds.

8148	houseofcb	Clara Metcalfe	My sister ordered 2 items. The bandage leggings and matching bandage body suit.We were expecting this to be really good quality as it cost over £100! It was heavy, sure... but the elasticity was appalling. She measured up just into their size Medium. I measured just into their Large. She's never ordered Medium before so she ordered a Small.The zip on the top wasn't great. It jammed on the seam of the bandage so you couldn't get it done up. When she took it off we managed to loosen it up but it's not an amazing zip. Design flaw. The next issue with the top is that there was wayyy too much halter strap and it's not adjustable, the panel across the boobs was way too wide and was just flappy. Could have done with a couple of inches off! Worse still, if you were a E cup+ the material would probably not have kept its shape long term.Next.... and worst! The leggings! O.M.G what an absolute p*ss take. So... they drowned her everywhere! They had no shape. I tried the Small on... fit my waist perfectly, but it made my thighs look huge, there was excess material on the legs and... at 6ft tall with the longest legs I know out of all my friends... I have inches of spare material at the bottom of the legs! God knows how a "small person" would be expected to wear this.I told House of CB about this on Facebook. They weren't very understanding of the issues and instead quizzed my sister's measurements. Regardless... she ordered a Small, shes meant to be a medium, and I AT A LARGE!!! Fit them with too much material. I argued with them for some time about the quality and they said to return them and they would refund delivery if there were manufacturing faults. AS IF THEY HADN'T TAKEN ON BOARD ANYTHING I'D TOLD THEM. They don't give a damn. Taking their customers for a ride. I said if there were no manufacturing issues, there was clearly an issue with the design and the model in the photos must have had her outfit tailored. It is total misrepresentation and false advertising of the garments. They said they would note this on there system and for me to return them.I did.... £11 later. They said they wouldn't refund postage as there was no manufacturing fault. What an effing joke! I'm sorry... but Wish could have done a better job.

You can’t alter tulle without destroying the fabric. So now, I’m going to wear my dress and when someone makes a comment about how uneven it is, I’m going to say, “thanks!

8159	houseofcb	M	EDIT: the response to this review from House of CB has only been a marketing tactic to showcase that they "care". Once I sent them the full follow-up - breakdown of what has happened (which is the 3rd time I have done it), they haven't even gotten back to me with a courtesy email to say that they received the response and are looking into it. I will say again: AVOID THE ONLINE STOREOriginal review:While the fit of the clothing is overall better than some other brands for tall and shapely ladies, the quality of the products and the customer service is absolutely abysmal! Before I bought in a store and recently made 2 consecutive orders online, thus the experience.Firstly, DO NOT order online, especially sale items. You will have to return the outfits in the original box (which is heavy) AND pay for the return postage yourself. They do not allow TNT or DPD delivery, so good luck with the postal office rates for the heavy clothing (most of their clothing is lined, have heavy security tags, etc) and the box.Secondly, Sale items are store-credit refund only. So even after a horrible service, you will have to pay for the return and will have to use or lose the money you have spent.Thirdly, the sizing of the products is all over the place. Some items fit for a shapely bottom and average cup size and some items will look great with bigger cup size, but good luck fitting into the bottom part... None of their bodies have opening at the bottom, meaning that you can do the toilet-dance or good luck taking it all off on a night out...  Sequin items will shed like crazy and lace will break! I variate between XS to M for any given item... Which increases the chance that you will have to return/exchange. Additionally, the so-called exchange service DOES NOT WORK. Initially they contact you to confirm which item you wish to exchange for, but if you ask ANY questions, their immediate reaction is to just refund you. There is no ticketing system in place and your one email will be answered by 5 different people, thus creating an even bigger confusion.Now, the item I wanted to order to complete my outfit is out of stock and I no longer can return the other complimenting outfit piece, as this exchange debacle took more that 14 days to "sort out".Finally, when I complained to them about this and asked to reverse the refund and give me the exchange I asked for, the answer was basically "no, can't help, sorry" and that's that. The fact that they gave a horrible service to me, didn't bother them whatsoever. None of my emails have been answered since then & there is no number to call. And truly literally, I reached out to them a second after the refund confirmation email hit my inbox - which is the opposite of what I wanted & all of this happened while a support thread for exchange was still on-going.STAY AWAY unless you are buying in the store and can try and test the items yourself.	2020-02-26	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e5666e83c93ae0bc40a8989	0.058552631578947384	neutral	["items", "exchange", "service", "return", "refund", "even", "email", "online", "clothing", "heavy"]
8160	houseofcb	Hannah	Poor returns policy. Considering the cost of the items on this site, I cannot believe they don’t do free returns. And not only do they not do free returns but they also charge you £6 for the original shipping price! Despite the fact it is free when you make the purchase? If I’m spending £129 on a dress the very least they could do is free returns. Obviously don’t care about their customers and trying to make as much cash as possible - rip off!	2020-02-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e55403f3c93ae0bc409ddbe	0.13443181818181818	neutral	["returns", "free", "make", "poor", "policy", "considering", "cost", "items", "site", "believe"]

It’s affordable luxury, I always feel amazing and confident when I am dressed in House of Cb. I have been searching for dresses like these for years and was so happy when I came across them 7 years ago. My wardrobe is adorned with their beautiful timeless pieces, they are always my go-to for any occasion. This brand really is incredible, if you are contemplating a purchase all I can say is, GO FOR IT! You will not be disappointed!	2020-02-21	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e4fafe53c93ae0864a48734	0.3309615384615384	positive	["house", "really", "beautiful", "brand", "always", "years", "fabric", "design", "craftsmanship", "items"]

8166	houseofcb	Mariela Meneses	I was introduced to this website by my sister about 4 years ago. I was hesitant because I had never bought anything before and only because I was not sure in sizing. I was looking for something unique to wear and decided to give it a try. Since my first purchase... I was hooked.From every question answered prior to, during and after ordering, to every inquiry in-between, to returns and refunds... I have to say the experience has been great. Very responsive, offer great suggestions and answers are always clear, helpful and friendly. I have read the bad reviews and honestly I would say 90% are just people who didn’t fully read policies prior to purchase or maybe were not so careful in trying on items thus making their experience different than mine. I am very a very happy customer thus far (knock on wood :-) as they say) Will continue to recommend and can’t wait to receive my next items.	2020-02-21	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e4f68263c93ae0864a4625c	0.21315789473684213	neutral	["say", "purchase", "every", "prior", "experience", "great", "read", "items", "thus", "introduced"]

8168	houseofcb	Bethanie	I first contacted House of Cb on 12/12/19 about two faulty bikinis. I was asked to send them back, which I did. It is now 19/2/20 and I have still not been offered a solution for this issue. Every customer service advisor has just put me off, and has offered me no help at all. It does not take over two months to inspect a bikini. I have been nothing but kind and understanding  within my emails, to only be treated like my issue is not important. I am a very loyal customer of the brand and I have made so many purchases in store and online and I’ve not had any trouble before. However this experience has tarnished the brand name for me, and I can’t see myself wanting to invest in it anymore. I’m very very upset with how this is being dealt with.	2020-02-19	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e4d2be43c93ae0bc4056f45	0.18259259259259258	neutral	["two", "offered", "issue", "customer", "brand", "first", "contacted", "house", "121219", "faulty"]

They responded stating the item had been worn, all labels/ribbons tampered with & no fault. I have photographic and video evidence proving the condition of the dress on the day it was  returned.  It's distressing to think a brand such as House of CB would resort to dishonesty  in a bid to  circumvent consumer rights.I've been online and found multiple reviews complaining of the same dishonest & illegal  practice.	2020-02-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e4b3b6d3c93ae0864a1c371	-0.058333333333333334	neutral	["dishonest", "consumer", "returned", "full", "dress", "fault", "infringe", "regulations", "price", "unworn"]

8177	houseofcb	Sam Taylor	I’ve been buying HOCB for years. Always, I’ve ordered a small or medium dress and it fit well, 34dd breasts were in place, etc. However, my last 2 orders have been a nightmare. I’ve had to exchange 2 dresses from a medium to a large because they did not fit my breasts any longer! My boobs are falling out of these dresses (which are NOT low cut/plunge/etc but a straight/square neckline) in the size large! And one dress had to be tailored, but it still barely keeps the girls in place and they’re overexposed. I’m very over it and it seems they cater to the petite small chested type. Just letting people know-if you’re busty, skip HOCB. Save yourself a headache.	2020-02-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e3ca6393c93ae04c0dc34eb	0.038214285714285715	neutral	["hocb", "small", "medium", "dress", "fit", "breasts", "place", "dresses", "large", "buying"]

8187	houseofcb	Alicia Elezovic	Writing from Melbourne, Australia, I never write negative reviews but believe women shopping from this brand online need to be wary. I've had 2 horrible experiences from House of CB and will be highly reluctant to ever buy from them again, it's a real shame because the quality of the clothes is there, but the service side is non existent/appalling.  Complete lack of transparency and accountability. The first time I made a purchase  - I was charged multiple times over a month period for a single item, my bank had to intervene for an error on their end, they never apologised for this. The second time everywhere on the website stated 3-4 day shipping to Australia, yet after I placed the order and a few days had passed without any confirmation of postage, I became concerned and emailed them asking for ETA. A few more days passed until I actually got a response (unlike the 24 hour window they promise) - I had a generic unapologetic response saying they had moved warehouses and shipping would take 10-12 days instead, to this I responded explaining I allowed plenty of time to receive the dress by my desired date (2 weeks I allowed) and that if it couldn't arrive in time/had not been shipped yet I wanted to cancel the order entirely, -I have no confidence this item will arrive in time for my event and I have had NO further response to my email/(even messaged over Facebook - House of CB, update your CRM software, it's 2020 and you're miles behind every other brand in this sense!) If you're buying for a special event from Melbourne/Sydney to be safe allow at least 3 weeks for this companies incompetence or head to David Jones directly. To be honest, wish there was another Aussie online store who stocked CB because at least then I'd have confidence in receiving something on time. My sister who also purchased a dress for an end of year work event, (3 weeks prior) did not receive her dress on time either. What a joke.	2020-01-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e32196b3c93ae04c0d65a34	-0.030421428571428565	neutral	["time", "days", "response", "dress", "weeks", "event", "australia", "never", "brand", "online"]

8196	houseofcb	Katie	I ordered a dress in the sale for my 21st birthday, the dress came and although I loved it, I felt I needed a smaller size. I then purchased a smaller size online. That same week I visited the house of Cb store in Manchester Arndale to have a browse, whilst I was there a staff member told me that when sending sale items back you are only offered a refund. This left me dishearten because I didn’t feel the website or order information communicated clearly this was the terms and conditions of sale items. Due to me ordering the exact same dress in a different size I contacted the customer service team through submitting a request through the website, I was pleased by the quick response and the outcome was I could get a refund for the dress I had sent back because it was clear I wanted to exchange.	2020-01-20	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e25dafb3c93ae04c0cfa14d	0.10931372549019606	neutral	["dress", "sale", "size", "smaller", "items", "back", "refund", "website", "ordered", "21st"]

8205	houseofcb	Michelle Comrie	I spent £200 on x 2 jump suits and x2 cardigans. The jump suit had a hole in it after wearing the item once for 3 hours. I asked the company if I could have a refund. After almost two weeks they refused. Offering me a gift voucher instead. The quality is poor. Primark are probably better in my view and have better customer service. The crotch on my jump suit is bobbly. The chenille cardigan feels lovely but is also disappointing for spending a larger amount of money. My advice. Be very careful and avoid! You have been warned. In fact pretty little thing and Boo Hoo have better lower priced items and fabulous customer service.	2019-12-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5e070d52c845450834370656	0.10000000000000002	neutral	["jump", "better", "suit", "customer", "service", "spent", "\\u00a3200", "suits", "cardigans", "hole"]

On opening it I was over the moon with the fit and the quality but after wearing it just once it ended up with lots of pulls in the fabric which was really upsetting and it gets more and more every time I wear it which is putting me off wearing it out of the house.

I am thinking maybe they decided to save on the postage on their side and then send my items altogether🤷🏿‍♀️ But who do you ask......their numbers don’t work and they don’t reply emails. Now just a few mins ago (12th Dec) they sent me an email saying thank you for your purchase , we wanted to let you know that we have received your order and it is being processed and you will receive a confirmation email once it’s been dispatched....a week later. That is unacceptable as there is no way of contacting this company. But if you go to their stores they do have telephones so I don’t really understand what this is all about. Appalling customer service. Now I want to cancel my order but how do I even do that....on the online account no order is even showing.

8227	houseofcb	MAOUDI	I am writing this review after I had , after my first order, decided to unfollow them from all social media  and never order from them again " they were dead to me " :) My first experience with House of CB was terrible, not because the dress I ordered was not gorgeous, it was, but despite following the size chart the dress would not zip up past my hips. I contacted house of CB at the time and discussed the possibility of my item being defective because I measured the dress and it was definitely not a 26 inch waist for a size small. I sent pictures of my measurements of the dress and explained that as a dancer I regularly get costumes made remotely so my measurements are as accurate as can be. House of CB were willing to exchange the item but would not cover the international shipping (which is alot), so I gave up. That dress still sits in my closet and even my sister who is much smaller than me couldn't zip it up. Then one of my favorite Youtubers reviewed a dress that I adored and it was from house of CB, so I decided to give it another chance.  First I got in touch with them over Instagram and the person who responded to my messages was incredibly sweet, quick to respond and helpful. She helped me pick the perfect size and I received the dress in Dubai 2 days later, it fit like a glove and is absolutely beautifully made. I was so pleased with both the customer service and the dress that I am now happy to submit a positive review. I am glad that I ordered a second time because I guess if one employee was not helpful, it doesn't mean that the retailer is to blame.  My final recommendation to house of CB would be (as it seems like an ongoing issue)  to update their sizing chart which is the same for all items but the items completely differ in sizing depending on the material and boning. For now at least when in doubt I will always order a size up :) .	2019-11-18	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5dd2984dc845450640c3c956	0.14531776094276094	neutral	["dress", "house", "size", "first", "order", "would", "review", "decided", "ordered", "chart"]

8284	houseofcb	Jess Collins	If I could give 0 stars I would. I've been a long term customer of House of CB and never had a problem until my last purchase. I spent over $500AUD for 3 pieces of clothing. I've always been a size xs in their clothes, but I have put on a couple of kilos, barely noticeable, so I measured my bust waist and hips and ordered size S in everything because they supposedly fit true to size and tell you not to size up or down, and my measurements were well within the size small range.The bodysuit I ordered which was a 2/3 stretch factor had NO stretch and it was so short I have myself a camel toe by the time my arms were in the straps. I'm  5'7 with normal sized torso and I felt like it was going to break like a rubber band would because it was so god damn short/ not enough fabric in the torso height wise. The zipper kept jamming too and I had to get my boyfriend to unzip me and he even commented on the poor quality of the material.Second item was meant to be a stretchy dress that again had NO stretch. the size small was so tight that I couldn't even get the dress over my butt and let me tell you, I have no hips or butt. So apparently I'm a size medium even though my measurements are a size small on their website...The third item was a pant and shirt set and it fit fine, but the material is disgusting quality and thin. The open back bodysuit was too big (ironic considering the other one didn't fit) and they were crushed worse than a screwed up piece of paper. I've bought better quality clothes at Kmart. So upset I spent a lot of money on clothes that are overrated. House of CB has gone downhill and you are pumping out new clothes every Monday but are clearly comprising in quality.And get your God damn sizing sorted. I still fit some of my XS house of CB items, yet your size S items don't fit me and I'm a medium? Like what ...Go elsewhere people, customer service help is non existent.	2019-08-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5d523f66f018690bd04d294b	0.02483064774731441	neutral	["size", "fit", "clothes", "ive", "house", "small", "stretch", "like", "get", "even"]

8287	houseofcb	Lovelle Martinez	DO MOY BUY FROM THIS STORE EVER. SAVE YOUR MONEY. THEY ARE A FRAUD. I bought a dress from them from their branch in Stratford London for £129.99 and they apparently went to exchange it for a new one but i did not check it before I left the store. Then I went to return it because I found another dress that was more suitable. So I went back to return it and apparently the ribbon had been sown back together. I did not touch the dress at all or even take it out from the back after I bought it. Then the manager went to do something and then came back. All of a sudden there are marks on the dress. I want a refund for this faulty dress. And I will complain to HR until I get a refund. The manager wasn't even taking the situation seriously so I knew she did something to the dress.	2019-08-12	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5d514980f018690bd04cb47f	0.07941919191919193	neutral	["dress", "went", "back", "store", "bought", "apparently", "return", "even", "manager", "something"]

For the same quality you have to buy Dolce and Gabbana!  I bought several products ... the Michiela skirt has a unique model I was looking for a long time, which reminds me of the skirts used by the movie Gilda!  Beautiful model and the dress is exactly as you see it on the website.  The details are very accurate as well as the finishes that make the difference.  the top Vivi wonderful ... great fabric.  when I wear Vivi with Michiela I feel sexy.  the top customer service in all.

8326	houseofcb	Lianne	I ordered the ‘Sasha bandage dress’ last week and upon opening the box I noticed that there were were flaws on the dress- as if the bandage had been stretched and marked After paying an enormous price for this dress I was very annoyed. I PM’d them to resurrect the situation and to my shock and exasperation they told me to go and get the dress DRY-CLEANED!!! This is a shocking and atrocious service and would not recommend buying from this site as the quality and service does not match the price!! I have asked for a new dress to be sent out and still have not heard back from them....

Plus I don’t need her figure to be able to pull off the same look! Quality fabrics that are lined, smoothing you out in all the right places. Super strong stitching & carefully thought out tailoring that holds your body. Sizing that is actually true to size. Combine all of the above with customer services that really want to help you & what’s not to love!	2019-07-13	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5d2a2689ccd70b09545959d3	0.27593005952380956	neutral	["pretty", "wait", "next", "pink", "ribboned", "box", "arrive", "mail", "receiving", "beautiful"]
8333	houseofcb	Marji Salinas	I have been a very big fan of House of CB products for 6 years now and they've never let me down! My loyalty to the company began when I purchased a house of CB (at the time was known as: "Celeb Boutique") dress and I must say that, I was stunned with how beautiful everything was. The fit was perfection, the materials of the dress were incomparable to any other clothing store. Not to mention, I live all the way in Canada and the arrival time was beyond quicker than what I expected. Plus, the packaging of the item was gorgeous (and still is to this day)! Since then, I have become a true House of CB fan. I ALWAYS get complimented and get asked about where I bought the item whether it's a fabulous dress, or a sexy bathing suit, the items never fail to turn heads! I proudly recommend house of CB to all of my friends, family and even strangers that come up to ask me. The designs of house of CB clothing are absolutely stunning, unique and the quality is exceptional! I have purchased several dresses online and I feel as if I have a connection with the brand because the clothes just fit my body so well and have always made me feel and look like a million bucks! What I love most about house of CB products is the attention to detail in everything; l LOVE how they add character and depth to the products! For example, when you are purchasing a dress, it's not just a simple dress, you are investing in the "Margi" dress (which is my nick name, lol so I bought it right away and it's my favourite dress of all time!). Now, I cannot wait to purchase the pair of "Andromeda" shoes (which is my daughter's name!) and exhault the personality of the shoes through me in the flesh! House of CB, I would like to thank you for making this insecure and shy woman, feel and look so luxerious, amazingly beautiful and confident in your clothing! Please continue to be the glorious brand that you are! Thank you again for never letting me down! 🤗🙌💜	2019-07-12	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5d282f78ccd70b08c007bed0	0.34108645983645974	positive	["house", "dress", "products", "never", "time", "clothing", "feel", "fan", "purchased", "beautiful"]

8339	houseofcb	Jaity Adrina	I'm located in Australia and ordered my very first House of CB dress in hopes to wear it for the after party of my wedding. I left it a little late and being indecisive as to what to choose, I wasn't too sure how long it would take to get to me. I ordered it on a Monday morning, and as soon as I made the purchase I messaged House of CB on Messenger to find out how long it will take to get to me.House of CB responded promptly, then advised that it would get to me on the Friday in the same week. However, I received my package by Wednesday, just 2 days after! I can't express how fantastic House of CB has been in responding to any enquire, such prompt service in getting the goods to the client and not to mention the fantastic packaging!I can't wait to wear the dress and will most definitely purchase more goods from House of CB!

8340	houseofcb	Laudie	I had been watching the lovely Carlotta dress for a few months to wear to my rehearsal dinner for my wedding. I was hoping for a sale some day soon and then they announced a July 4th sale! I was ecstatic! When you’re planning a wedding even a savings of $10.00 bucks makes you happy because of how much cash you’re dishing out. I went to place my order and the dress was sold out in my size. I messaged them on twitter asking if I could still receive the holiday discount bc the item was sold out. They messaged me immediately to verify and then said they’d honor the discount. They notified me when the dress restocked, I tried ordering the same day and it was sold out again. So I informed them and they offered to let me pre order the dress at the discounted price as long as I was willing. I can’t tell you how much I appreciated this level of customer service, timely communication and consideration. Definitely ordering from them again.	2019-07-10	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5d265428ccd70b0314528dab	0.17638888888888887	neutral	["dress", "sold", "wedding", "sale", "day", "much", "order", "messaged", "discount", "ordering"]

8348	houseofcb	Melissa Clegg	I ordered a dress for an event and even thought it came in a decent time, the return process has been a nightmare! The dress was too small and therefore I sent it back as instructed on the returns sheet. This was on the 4/6/2019 yet I am still waiting a refund! I eventually emailed them and they asked for proof of postage, so I sent a picture! They stated they could not track my parcel ( a lie) as I was able to do it on Royal Mail website and it was stated the it was delivered on 6/6/2019, after stating this they said it wasn’t in their warehouse and so they can not give me a refund and go through the post office. After speaking to the post office they stated that they couldn’t do anything as the item has been delivered! After sending lengthy emails I kept getting back the same response of claim through the post office! Which even when I explained what the post office said they just used the same automated reply and never the same person replying! This is very bad customer service as the proof of the item being delivered is there In black and white!!! But nope they were still refusing my money back which is £109 so I have now had to open a case with my bank to get my money back as this is not right that they are with holding my money! I would advise no one to shop online with this company if there is a chance you will return as you will not get your money and you will not get any help from customer service.	2019-06-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5d0f7b80b055990650fca3f9	-0.04479365079365079	neutral	["back", "post", "office", "money", "stated", "delivered", "get", "dress", "even", "return"]

And don’t get me started on the quality ! The quality of these outfits are insane. As long as house of cb continues to make good products I’ll keep buying. ALSO their sizing is amazing. They don’t make anyone feel as if they’re too big or too skinny for an outfit. I’m a size 10 and I wear a small and my sister is a size 8-10 and we SHARE outfits that’s how amazing their sizing is.

8351	houseofcb	Coco	I have written a 5 star review before for HOCB but I wanted to refresh it due to their consistent and continuous excellent customer service and stunning clothing as the years have gone by since I started using them.Where to start? Well I literally shop with them every week. They release new pieces every Monday morning. I never hit the snooze button on a Monday (how sad), I just adore them.Their clothes make me feel really special and I’m always receiving such lovely compliments - they are my go to brand, my absolute favourite.The fit of their clothing is for the most part true to size, they hug your body in all the right places but sometimes you might need help zipping up your dress if you have long nails. Many of their tops and dresses are corseted and take a bit of wiggle and help to get into but they’re suppose to be like that so I wouldn’t advise anyone to size up as they’re suppose to be tight around the waist.Remember in Victorian Days when they worse corsets, they needed an army to help them into their dresses.I’m a size 10 which could either be a small or a medium at HOCB with the way their sizing works. I typically order a size small (which is an 8-10) as that’s what fits me best overall however I have a big bum and hips so sometimes need to size up to a medium (which is a 10-12) if there’s no stretch to the fabric.I’m honestly obsessed with this company probably to an unhealthy level.I’ve had a couple of very minor issues (and I mean VERY minor, not even worth mentioning tbh) but they were dealt with swiftly, professionally and to my satisfaction 100%Their customer services is honestly the best I’ve ever had from any company and I can tell they really appreciate me as a customer.As with any company, they make all sorts of pieces to cater for all tastes and while there are some things that aren’t perhaps my cuppa tea, more often that not..... I’m super excited about placing an order and adding another piece to my ever growing collection.I’m not sure if they’ve taken on new designers lately or not but I’m honestly just loving their latest collections more than ever.The quality of their clothing is like no other, you very much get what you pay for at HOCB and I think their stuff is worth every penny. If you’re wondering about investing the extra ££ for something special then I would say GO FOR IT, you won’t get anything like it elsewhere.So full stars on everything from me, there’s nothing I would change about them at all.Oh and their website is fabulous, you can track the process of your order every step of the way from it processing to arriving at your front door.I’m a very, very happy loyal customer here and will continue to shop with them and recommend them to absolutely everyone I come into contact with.

8352	houseofcb	grace	Wow where do I start! I was a loyal customer until recently. I purchased an item in the sale that was damaged. I couldn’t undo the zip past a certain point it just kept getting stuck. Rather than attempt to forcefully undo it I simply emailed and returned as instructed to without even being able to try the dress on. Since then they have refused to give me a full refund on a faulty dress, only a gift card. I understand they have a no return policy IF THE DRESS ISN’T FAULTY the fact that it is faulty they should give me a refund under then consumer rights act. They claim there is no fault when I know full well there was. I have contacted the ombudsman and trade and standards.

8354	houseofcb	Summer	So let’s start with saying I’ve worn a House of CB for years. Way before celebrities caught on. I was a very loyal customer and my personal shopper worked for the company so he would always make sure to send me the new styles so I could purchase them. I love the fit of most of their clothes and the materials. Now recently I was trying to purchase a top it was only $105 but I was told that I could not purchase because I did a chargeback on an item I bought a few months back. So as I’m sitting in confusion I email the company back and tell them I’ve never done that. I was told that they blocked my card and my email. Wow I’m upset because I’ve been shopping for years and to say that without sending me proof and details is an insult. Thought I loved this company now I’m not so sure. Sincerely a very upset off ex customer.	2019-06-10	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5cfe90d7b0559908d8d4eb27	0.25115864527629234	neutral	["company", "purchase", "years", "customer", "sure", "could", "told", "back", "email", "upset"]

8365	houseofcb	Taylor Kentel	I am so pleased with the service of this store! Not only are the quality of every piece of clothing amazing, body flattering and well made. The stores employees in California were so welcoming and helpful. I also recently ran into an issue when needing to return a gift that I wasn’t given (bought in store)-though I couldn’t make it into the store. cb helped resolved the solution so quickly and allowed me to send the item to their warehouse for store credit. Love this store and company!!	2019-05-25	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ce95a46a84369077cdaa118	0.3899305555555556	positive	["store", "pleased", "service", "quality", "every", "piece", "clothing", "amazing", "body", "flattering"]
8366	houseofcb	Danielle Abbott	DO NOT BUY FROM THIS BRAND.I recently purchased the pink 'Camila' dress online. When it arrived I tried the dress on once and the pink colour did not suite my fair skin tone so I decided to return it. I sent the dress back in immaculate condition, I ensured this as I have heard in the past the company can be tricky with returns. I returned it within the 14 day period specified and by signed for first class postage to ensure its safe arrival. Over two weeks after the dress was posted back I received an automated email saying the team "refused" to issue the refund due to the quality of the dress. No explanation, no specific reasons why (because there were none and the dress was in perfect re-salability condition!) Which I am sure the dress has more than likely been resold! There was no customer service number to contact, or address to dispute this. Furthermore, they said they would issue a gift card for me to use online.. which still has not been sent to me!!!! I find this companys customer service less than satisfactory and I would strongly advise anyone against using this company unless you want to waste hundreds of pounds and never get them back.	2019-05-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ce65ae9a84369077cd97c2d	0.15482456140350875	neutral	["dress", "back", "pink", "online", "sent", "condition", "company", "issue", "customer", "service"]
8377	houseofcb	Laura Carter	AVOID!I bought the 'Celine Off White Chenille Slouchy Cardigan' around February time. In the 12 weeks (or so) that I have had it, and bare in mind it has NOT been worn very often, the threads in the cardigan have become loose in places and makes the cardigan look horrific. Now the cardigan wasn't cheap, and regardless of the price, I do not expect a product that I have only had for 12 weeks to have become faulty. Even if I had worn the product every day, this should not happen!So, I sent an email on Sunday 21st April explaining the product's fault and offered to send photos for evidence. Surprisingly, I got an email the very next day asking for photographic evidence but a week on, I am still waiting for a response!Their customer service is abysmal! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!	2019-04-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5cc8af4aa8436906ec5d8dd1	0.02730769230769231	neutral	["cardigan", "weeks", "worn", "become", "product", "day", "email", "evidence", "avoidi", "bought"]
8367	houseofcb	Susan AA	So I was on vacation to London and I bought a FORNARINA Black Dress fromthe Top Shop at the Westfield London store so I could wear it to a work party i had on Friday the 22.march.I  opened the wrapping to try it again and I discovered an alarm. Im was disappointed that i would not be able to use this dress until i travel to London again because your employee forgot to take of the alarm.  I live in Norway so my plans where ruined and I had to go buy a new dress. I contacted your customers service on the 19.march to complain and get some help with recipts from the store i bought it from and sent pictures.Its now been 2 months since I complained and you guys really dont care about your customers, this is the worst customers service I have ever experienced. I have sent 4 emails every two weeks and alI you say every single time is that you will ‘’refer this to our Management’’.I wiill never buy from you again and warn everyone  I know to never do that either.Your employee forgot to take of the alarm on a 140 pund dress and you leave the customer to wait 8 weeks without an answer?Why are you guys so rude to people who spend their hard earned money on buying  clothes from you? 140 Pound of my money waisted and down the drain.This is not acceptable at all and and a terrible way to treat your customers.UPDATE: They lied and said they would look into it as you can see under my comment  so they dont look bad on here!Do NOT trust this company at all!	2019-05-20	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ce1f725a843690ac8c130c3	-0.1648493867243867	negative	["dress", "london", "alarm", "customers", "bought", "store", "would", "employee", "forgot", "take"]

8372	houseofcb	Sally Diaz	I just received a very unexpected and yet very good costumer service.For a while I've been checking out House of CB products. Although I think some of the pieces are stunning so are the models who wear them. I imagine this standard escape my demographic, petite 5'3, 119lbs, slim/athletic. So after reading all the descriptions and with some doubt that not every single model cannot be possibly wearing XS, I decided to adventure for the 3 items special all in size XS. I received the products in a very nice pink/peach box, I could tell that the quality was better on one piece more than the other but I was excited to wear them. So I try them on and I was very disappointed; they just did not fit right and the length of the pants were just ludicrously long. After reading the policy I knew I could not return, nor exchange these products. So I wrote to House of CB via email and someone really great "Noel" accepted to make an exception and let me return the them for a full store credit to use on their website. Although I would've preferred a full refund, I was grateful that at least someone replied back and gave me an option. Sadly I'm returning the products, but I'm happy to have come across Noel, so it is not a total loss. I will take my time and be more thorough ordering any item, because the prices are very high and these are not your regular any day clothes. Thank you House of CB and Noel, I appreciate it.

8379	houseofcb	Serinna	The ‘Rinah’ dress in hot pink is a must-need for any collection. It’s such a lovely and feminine shade of pink - the type that you just feel tempted to stroke because the color is so inviting! It holds me in the right places and I don’t feel self-conscious about any uneven rolls peeking through from under the fabric. My House of CB dress collection has mainly consisted of cool-tones - pink is definitely not a color I usually gravitate toward. This dress is not an off/fake/flashy Barbie doll pink. The fabric and style of this dress work so well for this shade of color. This dress changed my opinion of pink for the better.	2019-04-24	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5cbfede1a843690980c78838	0.05195578231292518	neutral	["dress", "pink", "color", "collection", "shade", "feel", "fabric", "rinah", "hot", "mustneed"]

I reached out on three different platforms thinking they wouldn’t respond right away but not only were they incredibly prompt but they wrote back on both FB and Insta to tell me they had emailed me.

8385	houseofcb	Michaela Grech	Bought a dress in the Topshop concession in the Trafford centre. The manager Halaina was very helpful when purchasing the dress. Wore the dress for around 3 hours and had it dry cleaned per the care label. When picking the dress up, the lady from the dry cleaners pointed out fraying on the zip and stitching coming undone under the left arm. Took the dress back to store and Halaina very rude said the dress was fine it wouldn’t come undone any more and she has 100% faith in the dress. Basically, she made out I was a liar. Asked for her managers details- sent her a lengthy email with pictures, and she replied me once asking for smaller pictures not heard another thing since. Told the manager I’m protected under the consumer right act 2015 still no reply- this is breaking the law. I am now currently applying to my bank for a chargeback. Had house of CB items before been over the moon with them, but it seems when there is an issue they just shut you down. Zero customer service skills.

Took several e-mails quoting consumer rights to get anywhere with this.  They issued a gift certificate at first despite me requesting a full refund.  As I was protected by consumer rights I held my ground with the e-mails and eventually got a refund. It's just stressful & a total hassle.However, I am still out of pocket by £3.95 for posting the dress back, they should have refunded this also as they were absolutely in the wrong for sending out such a shoddy garment to me in the first place.	2019-04-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5cb4ab6ca8436908c40a4699	0.02083333333333334	neutral	["dress", "back", "\\u00a3395", "emails", "consumer", "rights", "first", "refund", "faulty", "arrived"]

8394	houseofcb	Hannah	As this is an honest opinion, I would firstly have to start off by saying that House of CB is my ultimate go to company for new stylish trends that compliment my figure. On the expensive side but you pay for quality and I absolutely LOVE their clothes. In fact they make up about 80% of my wardrobe. Having said that there is a valid explanation as to why I am giving a 1 star review. For the first time ever I have encountered a situation where I am left with a faulty item from house of CB. And the customer service is less than favourable, in fact it is utterly appalling. I am quickly learning that house of CB is all well and good until it comes to protection of the consumer. Then it's a different ball game. I made a purchase of a bandage dress from house of CB 2 weeks ago and wore it out for a mothers day dinner. I soon encountered the sheer humiliation of the dress fabric unravelling from the bottom up almost like a ladder in a pair of tights so if it is at all stretched, the fray runs further up the dress  (the dress is utterly unwearable and essentially is falling apart). Its clear at this point the dress is not durable and is no longer fit for purpose. I wrote to House of CB almost immediately to make them aware of the issue and to ensure the dress would be accepted as a return before I shipped it off so I sent pictures of the fault. I did this because their dresses are so expensive to return due to their weight. But sure enough they asked me to return the dress for inspection. I did. Two days ago I requested an update on my return to which they informed me that they had shipped out a new one. I did not want a new one as I fear the same would happen again and I stated o  the form that I wanted a refund. So this new dress was dispatched without me authorising this as a remedy for my faulty item. (I did not accept the parcel off of the delivery driver)When confronted equipped with the backing of the consumer rights act 2015 (this states that all faulty items can be returned to the seller for a FULL REFUND if returned within 30 days, or and exchange/repair can be offered for up to six months AFTER the 30 days. In these circumstances the stores return policy does not play a part and it is totally irrelevant as to whether the dress has been worn) this was explained to house of CB via Facebook messenger, as this appears to be my only point of contact as all my emails were ignored. unfortunately, this store seems to think they are above the law. They are not. I tried to compromise and said I would accept store credit but they turned this down. It is illegal for the store to refuse me my right to refund so it was kind for me to even offer this compromise.. I requested a letter of deadlock to present to an ombudsman. Again, I am yet to receive this. There are zero appropriate points of contact for issues like this where people need answers! In the 21st century for a company to have not even one telephone contact is absolutely ridiculous. I also have to say how comical and yet sickening it is to think that people in charge of sales and in positions of management in a sales company are not educated and have such a massive lack of knowledge in the most basic statutory consumer rights. This was shocking for me as it is the kind of thing you learn in high school. And even after e plaining it to them... they still dont seem to comprehend that I AM TOTALLY PROTECTED AND WITHIN MY RIGHTS TO A REFUND. I dont understand why this is so confusing to them but good luck trying to explain it. One thing I want to say to all consumers who shop at house of CB is please please please KNOW YOUR RIGHTS! dont let them bully you as they are trying to bully me and a few other girls who's reviews I have read on here in similar situations to me. ... I see on here tha another girl who experienced this last month had a response from the company under her review saying that it's because her dress was worn that she wasnt offered a refund. This is utter utter nonscence! Ok so let's be clear, DO NOT for the name of goodness let these people try to feed you this BS. Because that's all it is. They are trying thier luck thinking that you wont know your entitlements. But luckily I am here to enlighten them. The dress could be worn 50 times over within those 30 days and they would still be obliged to refund. Again know your rights and stand by them with everything you've got so companies do not get away with this.  Let me warn you, they are going to try every trick In the book to make you think you are not entitled to your refund so be prepared for them, do your research and make your rights a known fact. I cannot stress this enough. This is why this law is in place to protect us from people like this! I'm sure house of CB will have something to say to this but like I say, the facts are there. They are not above the law. They are 100% liable. And I will fight this in small claims court if I do not get the legal response I'm looking for.UPDATE: After a lot of back and forth, the company finally took responsibility and issued me my refund. Persist when you are right to.	2019-04-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5cae4929a843690a301ba06e	0.06917325637325637	neutral	["dress", "house", "refund", "rights", "would", "company", "return", "new", "make", "like"]

8396	houseofcb	Rattanaphone Tuta Phoumy	I’ve always been obsessed with House of CB because of the unique design and quality!  I would stop myself from buying because it is a little pricey but I totally understand why.  When I first laid my eyes on the leopard “Athena” dress, I knew I had to buy it.  It was screaming my name so I finally made my first purchase!!! It’s the cutest feminine little dress ever.   I can’t wait to wear it to Ariana Grande’s concert!  House of CB also provides super lightening fast free shipping and the dress was delivered in the cutest pink wrapped box with a pretty bow. I’m obsessed and I can’t wait to make more purchases!!!

8397	houseofcb	Arlene W.	I discovered House of CB via Instagram in February 2019. I was skeptical at first about ordering my first product because as a regular online consumer, there are many eCommerce brands that have poor quality products, poor or non-existent customer service, difficult and expensive return/shipping methods. I’m more than delighted to report that I have experienced exceptional customer service (quick response to order inquiries, very friendly and going above and beyond to meet requests), high quality and luxurious products (hardware, materials) delivered in beautiful packaging, easy return or exchanges and fast delivery to Canada (international). House of CB has surpassed my expectations. A big thank you to Noel and Isabel for the outstanding customer service you offer. This quality and care of service is rare today. I truly appreciate it! As such, I have purchased several gorgeous items from House of CB since March and am now a loyal customer. Friends have taken notice of my HCB products and I continue to boast about HCB on IG and more. Highly recommended. Keep up the great work!	2019-04-04	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ca62784a843690a2cc49e33	0.23868279569892473	neutral	["customer", "service", "house", "quality", "products", "first", "poor", "hcb", "discovered", "via"]

It was soo embarrassing and cheap! I was promised if it returned it and it was of fault of there’s (manufacturing) I would be fully refunded for the dress and shipping I had paid to return it. So I did and they took it as fault and I requested my refund then with out my agreeing they put the dress costs on to a gift receipt! And now are refusing to put anything into my account even through I don’t want to shop with them against went out of pocket £7.00 for shipping the faulty crap back to them. They are unfriendly over email too. Be careful ordering! They charge big money for cheap dresses and there customer service team are on primark level! The consumer rights act in the uk is any costumer is eligible for a full refund for a faulty item especially if it’s returned within a short time period.

8450	houseofcb	Jacqueline Unzueta	House of CB has a beautiful selection of dresses. I had the hardest time finding a clothing line that is sexy, elegant, and good quality until I found House of CB. For my birthday, I ordered the pink CAMILLA dress. However, I fell in love with the LEXI corset dress that I just had to have for this occasion. I contacted House of CB through Messenger, and the person who helped was extremely accommodating and attentive to my messages to make this dress swap possible. I am happy to say that my LEXI dress is now on its way home after a span of a few hours! This will be my first House of CB dress. I am very excited to wear this beauty, and I am really grateful for their exceptional customer service and expedited Next Day Delivery process. I will have the most gorgeous birthday dress on time for my birthday weekend, and I'd like to thank everyone in the House of CB team who made it possible. Your efforts do not go unnoticed.

8471	houseofcb	Lauren	So I’m updating this review because I am genuinely happy with how fast my dress arrived. I realized half way through my complaints that it was mainly the FedEx problem and not House of CBs. Their customer service reached out and became communicative while FedEx was being difficult (as usual). I don’t recommend FedEx they are super unreliable and have a reputation for being so. However I wanted to thank you House Of CB for the gorgeous dress. The quality and fit is outstanding. This is why I always go to you guys for large events like my bday, Valentine’s Day, and New Years. Overall, difficulties with delivery were not their problem so I guess my only feedback is find a different delivery service other than FedEx.	2019-02-12	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c62e2c497afa109ac86d28a	0.15056141774891774	neutral	["fedex", "dress", "problem", "house", "service", "delivery", "updating", "review", "genuinely", "happy"]

I returned a jumpsuit due to a manufacturing fault on its sewing - there was a massive gap between the thighs/legs that looked as if I had male genitals (more specifically a penis/phallus) and it bunched up. I contacted customer service and all they could do was say they could not refund shipping for the return of the item - even when I said I was repurchasing on their site. They were also dismissive and unwilling to work with me. I even suggested no money back if they could at least give me a discount on my next purchase - still, they wouldn't budge.

8493	houseofcb	Yasib	I hate this company and will never purchase again even if I like the clothing! I tried on a dress and came to purchase it they offered to get me a fresh one that was from the back they didn’t show it to me and just wrapped it up..I ended up wearing the dress to go out and realised a hole in the sleeve I sent it back to CB and even recieved an email off them apologising for the manufacturing fault. They stated they’ve fixed it and will send me the dress back when I got it I was so angry to find they’d hand stitched it and it was so obvious and completely different to the rest of the dress. I had to spend money again sending it back and it’s been 9 days I’ve not heard back from them. Any other company would give you a refund or a exchange for a new dress! Rubbish customer service and rubbish materials used for the clothing compared to the prices!!!! Complete waste of time and money do not buy nothing from them!	2019-01-27	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c4d88f197afa10388c0721e	-0.06392341382575759	neutral	["dress", "back", "company", "purchase", "even", "clothing", "money", "rubbish", "hate", "never"]

8495	houseofcb	James	Probably the worst company ever. I bought a dress for my wife and it was the last one in stock. The dress was 300$ so not cheap at all. Once I received the dress it wasn't the good one, they sent me a 50$ dress. I asked what they could do since the dress we initially bought was now out of stock. So they offered me to keep the dress(big joke) or to get a refund but I would need to send the dress back. So obviously I opted for a refund. Once they received the dress they gave me a refund but never refunded me the shipping cost and now I feel like I'm going in circle trying to get back the shipping cost. Their customer service reps are also pretty clueless about anything and it always takes a long time before I get any responses. I went through all this headache and trouble just because their employee couldn't quality check their package and put the right dress.Also my refund came from House of CB HONG KONG, so much for a company that is claimed to be from the UK. And guess where else you can get "House of CB" dresses that haven't been rebranded as "House of CB"... a few aliexpress stores located in HONG KONG. Is this a coincidence? doubt it. So much for a company that claims that their designs and clothes are original and made in house. Oh and guess what? The aliexpress dresses that I actually ordered from, which came in the right size and the right model, has the exact same material and quality for 1/5 of the price.I never use trustpilot but I had to make an account to tell people to stay away from this shady company. I would rather spend my hard earned money in another company that actually has customer service and that actually cares.	2019-01-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c4a792a97afa10ac082afda	0.025619047619047607	neutral	["dress", "company", "get", "refund", "house", "right", "actually", "bought", "one", "stock"]

8497	houseofcb	Jade Henry	Poor quality products. I initially ordered a dress from the site it was really poor quality material it was bought on sale but even then was over priced for the quality of the product. Unfortunately, I could not get a refund. Customer service when dealing with the inquiry was good, however. Months later I placed another order to try and use the gift voucher I have been stuck with. Again the items were not great quality. I ordered multiple bra's various versions all of which was not great, and a clutch bag which looked ok however could not close once even the smallest of items were added. I had to pay to return the items despite the fact that the return was down to manufacturing issues. And now stuck with more vouchers which I don't even want to use.	2019-01-18	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c41efb49d378009a45e9b40	-0.04273504273504272	neutral	["quality", "even", "items", "poor", "ordered", "could", "however", "use", "stuck", "great"]

8499	houseofcb	Natasha Baugh	Worst customer service I have ever received, generally the worst online retail experience I've ever had. Ordered a sale dress and returned it for a gift card; this is their policy, fair enough. Had to spend £14 on postage back to make it within their time constraint and ensure the dress was not lost which is crazy; how an online store in this day and age can not offer free returns is beyond me, especially when their dresses are so expensive. Had to hound customer service to stay up to date with my refund which was unnecessary hassle. Ordered a new dress with my money and wanted to later apply the gift card, which is a reasonable request! Again had to keep hassling the customer service team to apply my gift card and refund me what I had already paid. It will take you about 5 hours minimum to receive any response from them, I waited days and weeks and actually never heard back via email, so had to hound them on social media until someone listened to me which was extremely annoying and unnecessary. This new dress was ordered for my 21st birthday, it was LOST by their AWFUL delivery company (Parcelforce), who actually didn't even attempt to deliver it correctly, I spent hours trying to track down what "neighbor" they had sent it to, and to no avail, they had completely lost it. Another TWO WEEKS go by with me trying to access a refund from House of CB who NEVER reply to my messages. I felt ridiculous messaging them time and time again with no response. Finally they tell me they are putting a claim through for my parcel for which I wait another week to hear if it has been successful. It was successful, so presumably they received appropriate compensation for the dress, after which they don't even refund me because they are telling me I didn't even pay for the dress because they ignore the fact that I paid with a gift card. Absolutely crazy to be told I didn't even pay for the dress myself. Finally after I send them message after message they send me back a gift card for the original amount - the cheek of it! As if I will ever want to order from them again?! After everything they lost, ruined and ignored, as a gesture of goodwill they can't even give me my money back because they can only refund via the original payment method. It wasn't like I was given this gift card as a present - it was MY money in the first place which they wouldn't give me back because I bought a sale dress! I found that last act to be completely insulting and disrespectful of everything they had done wrong. NEVER order from this company; hands down the worst experience of my life and I am utterly shocked at the way they treat their customers.	2018-12-20	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c1b572a9d37800b04068176	-0.11122226251880508	negative	["dress", "gift", "card", "back", "refund", "even", "lost", "worst", "customer", "service"]

So on that basis we had to order more stuff to add upto £90..It arrived, my daughters sports top had a massive hole in it and they sent me the wrong bag.  Two faults..but I still had to pay for the return..Lots of correspondance between us on imessage.  They agreed to refund the postage and the bag (which I only bought as we had a store credit)  I said I didn't want a store gift card again, they said they would refund it as it was there fault and guess what they have now issued another store card.  To say i'm not happy would be an understatement..They are an awful company to deal with, very old fashioned and I would certainly never recommend anyone buy anything..

I ordered a dress 9 days ago, it stated delivery in 6-7 days, they are now saying they may dispatch it by the end if the week so after 14 days. By which point the event it's for will have past. And despite contain house of cb they have not made any attempt to address this simple thank me for contacting them, but they literally take no action at all. I would not order from them again   given they can't even delivery the product to you and don't seem to care at all. They didn't even tell me it hadn't been dispatched until I contacted then after 7 days had already passed. Absolutely disgusting service. I would no recommend ordering from this site.In response to your reply, yes I have responded. I have been in frequent email communication with your customer service over the last two days. Firstly I have ordered and paid for it so why I don't see why you are waiting to send it, bet you didn't hesitate to take the money. Secondly Iv already received emails and a text to day its been dispatched and will be delivered today, then get an email after that to day it won't be till tomorrow. Why then send me an email saying its already dispatched. Maybe you should communicate better with one another! I have now changed my working day to wait in for delivery and cannot do this again tomorrow now. And however you look at it it is still over 7 days and until I posted on here your customer service team didn't want to know.To be clear, the dress still hasn't arrived a d now I'm being told tomorrow yet again. Iv had a text and email yesterday to say it had been dispatched and would be delivered on the 11/12 but today I had another text and email to say its now been dispatched and will be delivered 12/12.  I literally don't believe this dress with ever appear that this point. I'm starting to wonder if it even exists.	2018-12-10	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c0e1cda9d37800a6883255c	-0.02045454545454545	neutral	["days", "dispatched", "email", "dont", "service", "customer", "dress", "delivery", "would", "even"]

I sent my dress back to them 3 weeks ago advising I wanted a refund and after multiple emails back and forth they completely ignored what I wanted and sent me a replacement dress.

8512	houseofcb	Sami01	Poor quality - no consistencyI bought a body suit some months ago in a size S. It arrived and fit beautifully so I decided to order another in a second colour. Having had this before and ordering in same size I didn't bother to try on as I was travelling to Italy and wanted to wear whilst away so I cut the tags off and packed. Whilst away I put my body suit on for a night out and was shocked at how differently it fit. I questioned if it had been sent in the wrong size or if I had ordered incorrectly but it turned out to be that the material is entirely different from the first. Having explained this to house of cb I would expect a professional company to offer an exchange or refund but instead they told me it's cut to the right size so nothing they can do. It is a shame they have took this attitude as I have often spent well with this company. I will spend my money elsewhere now.	2018-11-09	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5be61e909d37800a4cda5579	0.045054945054945054	neutral	["size", "body", "suit", "fit", "whilst", "away", "cut", "company", "poor", "quality"]

I personally are contacting trading standards and the ombursman. I didn’t realise that they do the same as they are to me, to everyone else.

I emailed there customer service and explained that I ordered the wrong size and needed to change & they come back straight away assuring me that it would be changed and that I had nothing to worry about and would not affect when I would receive. Well, true to their word the right size came and within the 2-3 day promise. the dress is unbelievable quality and i will 1000% be ordering from them again.

8517	houseofcb	Clara	Terrible company. Dresses are nice yes but the whole returns policy is shocking and not worth the hassle of buying from them. I bought a dress for £150 which was previously £200. Because it was in the sale I cannot get a refund, only store credit or an exchange. This is ridiculous considering that I spent so much money on the dress regardless, and nothing on their website is cheap. People can’t help it if the item doesn’t fit- that is all part of online shopping. Yes they do warn you that certain items can’t be returned or can only be refunded with store credit but this policy is shocking regardless. If it was £20 that I had in store credit that is fine, but they are effectively forcing you to buy other items with them because they keep your money. This is a really shady tactic and not something I would expect from such an expensive boutique company. Not worth your time - I would give 0 stars if I could. I don’t want other people to fall into the same trap that other people have already.	2018-09-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5badcb8a8c83fd0b58dd1f4e	-0.07976190476190476	neutral	["store", "credit", "people", "company", "yes", "policy", "shocking", "worth", "dress", "money"]

8519	houseofcb	Laura Keenan	If I could leave a zero star i would. I recently attended a wedding and ordered dresses from various different places, House of CB being one of them. firstly I ordered the dress for next day delivery which cost £5.99 and I didn't receive it until 2 working days following the order being placed.  The dress arrived and it didn't sit nice on me, I took it to the post office to return it, this cost me £6.50.  I got no e-mail to advise they had received the dress returned to them, despite me seeing online that it was delivered to them and signed for by a staff member names "wicks" , I e-mailed them myself 3 working days following them receiving the item at their offices.  I got a rude e-mail back from Carla.  On the e-mail I first sent to them, I asked about being refunded the next day delivery cost to myself, Carla was rude and dismissive of my query and said I wasn't getting my money back.  I sent another e-mail back querying that it has cost me £12.49 to get a dress sent to me and then return it, Carla then failed to e-mail me back any explanation offer any customer support.  The other companies I used were faultless in returns and customer service/ support and I will never use House of CB ever again!!  im honestly so disgusted at how dismissive this Carla one was and her attitude, im sure she would be delighted paying £12.49 for absolutely nothing.  I wouldn't mind paying the delivery to get the dress if I actually received it on time, however I didn't.  I 100% disagree on having to pay for a return when I already paid delivery!! Joke of a company with zero customer support	2018-09-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5baa44988c83fd0828322a11	0.053125	neutral	["dress", "email", "delivery", "cost", "back", "carla", "didnt", "return", "sent", "customer"]
8520	houseofcb	enoladean	This review is about an Associate named Kristina Sanchez at the San Diego House of CB store inside of Top Shop. Please see the email I sent to her District manager “Natalie”Hi Natalie, Please excuse my grammatical errors as I am typong this outside of your partnershop in TopShop. I have had the worst very possible experience with your store manager Natalie Sanchez. On 9/8 I visited your store and was helped he entire one by an associate named Makenzie. Makenzie was aware that I had an event to attend to and knew that I was still undecided on what I was going to wear. I then purchased the black jumpsuit where it was hen that she cut the pink ribbon off of the jumpsuit. I did not know his was an issue since I am not an employee of House of CB and was unaware that this was a serious issue). Anyway, I ended up not wearing the jumpsuit and left the tags everything on as usual. Today, I return to your store with the receipt, jumpsuit with the tags still attached. And proceeded to speak with your manager Kristina Sanchez. She then informs me that she cannot return the jumpsuit because Makenzie doesn’t work for house of cb but works for top shop? She then says she can only give me a store credit? And that it’s the policy that the pink ribbon had to be attached. I vehemently told her that as a customer why would I be punished for someone else’s mistake? And no wear on the receipt says anything of a pink ribbon. She tells me if it were one or “her girls” she would be able to do it but because Makenzie doesn’t work there she can’t do it. Not only was I upset but I begin to ask her for additional help from someone in management and she then becomes extremely rude and starts telling me she “it” and I can take this issue up with customer service through an email. Kristina has to be the nastiest, rudest customer service agent I have ever encountered and I am not sure why someone like her represents this company. At this point I am also emailing corporate to get this resolved as well. The other issue is that when I spoke to a top shop manager she went with my mother to speak with Kristina to get your information and she was again extremely rude and refused to answer questions about the return policy (the top shop manager on duty witnesses this and said she was very rude as well). If you receive this message and can help me in anyway please call me at	2018-09-15	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5b9d75f68c83fd0b58d86d4f	-0.02648148148148148	neutral	["store", "manager", "jumpsuit", "kristina", "top", "shop", "makenzie", "issue", "sanchez", "house"]
8521	houseofcb	Amanda Thornton	My daughter got a jumpsuit  for her leaving do Costing £120 As soon as she turned up at the venue it had stitching coming undone on the bottom area and also down the sides and under the arm. Lots of witnesses at the party saw this (She's size 10 and purchased size m which wasn't too small or anything so it is definately down to the quality) She went home and put something else on which ruined the atmosphere of her party and she was really upset.  I've been emailing House of CB all week and it takes a day for them to get back they've finally said return it for repair.  Twice I've asked them to confirm the delivery address and department to send it to they do not answer my question.   I've had items from this shop with no problem but I will never shop at this place again after this disgraceful customer service!!!!!'	2018-09-14	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5b9b7c118c83fd06e0c01d1b	-0.06018518518518518	neutral	["ive", "party", "size", "shop", "daughter", "got", "jumpsuit", "leaving", "costing", "\\u00a3120"]

8524	houseofcb	Lizzie	In the process of seeking legal advice against  this company for false allegations . I had purchased a white dress which looked white on the website  but when it arrived, it was not in a good condition and the colour did not look as white as on the website, the colour was very washed out. I immediately  put the dress back in the box to return back.  Later on, I received an email accusing me of wearing the dress and putting  a lot of  fake tan stains all over.  I am a black  woman , i have never worn fake tan or makeup in my life and this company is trying to put false accusation against. This is not the first time either  me, my friends or other people i know  that have returned items in House of cb due to bad quality/ fault  which to me suggests that they  don't do a good quality check when sending their product out to customers and instead  accuse customers for wearing their product and refuse to do a refund even when the tag is still around the dress. I repeat again, am back, i do not wear fake tan or make up and do not tolerate false accusation, if i do not get my money back i will proceed  with legal claim against false allegation.	2018-07-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5b57374d9d2def0fc4300441	-0.07866666666666668	neutral	["false", "dress", "back", "white", "fake", "tan", "legal", "company", "website", "good"]

I bought my daughter a dress for her prom for £89 which was NOT in the sale but had a small discount. It was returned immediately as it didn't fit and the quality was terrible. She has received a credit note and they are refusing to refund me. I will be speaking the trading standards and as the Consumer Rights Act is supposed to protect us for Companies like this I will be in contact to see what they can do.

8527	houseofcb	Michelle Berry	I would give zero if l could - THE MOST DREADFUL 'CUSTOMER SERVICE' OF ANY COMPANY I HAVE EVER SHOPPED WITH!! Bought a £129 dress, wore it once and during the course of the evening the hem came apart. Took the dress back to the Manchester store - they refused a refund (against the law!) and said they would get it repaired in 7-10 days. 3 weeks later dress came back and the seam was dreadful but even worse the dress had 3 large 'bumps' in it where it looks like the seamstress had stretched the material whilst sewing it. I sent numerous emails, got Citizens Advice involved but still no joy! They refused to tell me their complaints policy, refused to tell me whether they are part of a resolutions scheme and refused to give me an English address. It seems the only way l will get a refund from this dreadful company is by taking them to the small claims court! Would never ever shop there again or recommend them!*UPDATE - despite saying they would 'look into' my complaint House of CB have not been in touch - obviously just wanted to look better after my poor review...failed miserably l'm afraid.

8528	houseofcb	Sam	I ordered a dress for over £100 online and paid £5.99 delivery. Now this is my fault for not reading the returns policy, but I find it outstanding that a large online retailer dare to ask that you pay for the return postage. Most online retailers value repeat customers and cover returns costs- which is right and fair. Additionally and for some bizarre reason, you are not allowed to return any items to a shop. Unheard of. I wasn’t expecting to have to return the dress, (I have other House of CB dresses in the same size) but the quality and fit was dreadful and very badly tailored. I will be returning the item, but decided to email to ask for the return postage to be covered given the poor quality of the item. I was given a short, purfunctionary, point-blank ‘no’ and was told that they ‘can’t’ do this. I would argue it’s more of a ‘won’t’. In their reply email they did not address any of my comments regarding the garment itself which I assume means they are not overly interested in customer feedback. I wish I’d read these reviews before buying. Do NOT buy online, and do NOT expect any sort of customer service. On a final note, having read most of the 5* reviews, I suspect there may be a fair few very obviously fabricated and fake reviews from the company themselves.	2018-05-03	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5aeb24386d33bc0b2c67c2ce	0.08642857142857142	neutral	["online", "return", "reviews", "dress", "returns", "ask", "postage", "fair", "quality", "item"]

I tried on the dress once and put the dress back in the box. I spent 70$ to ship the dress back to exchange for a size up as the dress was for a wedding in Jamaica. I received an email accusing me of wearing the dress as a ribbon had "fallen off" and "the dress showed signs of wear". I sent various emails stating I did not wear the dress. Over 7 emails later the response I receive is "your case is being reviewed by management". It has been 4 weeks of my dress sitting in Vegas with no response. No one will get back to me. This has been the absolute worst experience with any online store. This company is pathetic. Give me my money back or send me the dress size I requested!	2018-04-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ae614366d33bc032094d5fe	-0.17499999999999996	negative	["dress", "back", "received", "online", "weeks", "size", "wear", "emails", "response", "absolutely"]
8531	houseofcb	Andrea Morales	I have just come back from one of your stores in London and at very disappointed with the lack of customer service provided from the manager. I purchased a dress for £139 (which isn’t cheap) so therefore I expected better quality. I try the dress home and it’s all fine, I take off the label because I had NO intention of taking it back because I love and trusted house of CB. When I go to wear it my partner points out that the stitching is coming off from different parts of the dress. By then, there was no way I could of gone to the store to explain and show the dress to a member of staff as I was at a wedding so I therefore had to keep the dress on. I came in store today and honestly explained my situation because I UNDERSTAND what it means if you take off the ribbon and because I HAD NO INTENTION to bring it back, I took it off. The manager of the store said that because it’s a bandage dress, the stitching tends to do that..... ermm sorry but it’s a £139 dress and the stitching SHOULD NOT be coming off regardless of the material. I wore it ONCE  for 5 hours and most of which I was sitting down. The manager of the store then said to me that even if they send it back to the warehouse, they’ll just return it back to me because apparently by ME wearing the dress, I would of stretched out the bottom of the dress?! So I said okay, but how do you explain the stitching coming off at the top of the dress?? And how do you explain the terrible stitching in the first place which is SUPPOSED to be STRAIGHT rather than wonky?? Her advice was to sell the dress online.... erm no? I PAID for the dress and I EXPECT it to last longer than HALF A DAY! Im soooo shocked by this terrible and inexcusable lack of customer service and despite me cutting off the ribbon I still have rights as a customer. I won’t be shopping there again. I have dresses that are a fraction of the price I paid that have lasted longer than that. So shocked and hugely disappointed.	2018-04-28	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ae454b86d33bc09284bda26	-0.0849910394265233	neutral	["dress", "back", "stitching", "store", "customer", "manager", "coming", "explain", "said", "disappointed"]

8533	houseofcb	Silva	Absolute worst experience I've ever had shopping.They charge you for shipping then you have to pay for shipping again when you pick up the product.  The carrier they used didn't do a delivery attempt so I had to go to the depot to pick up the dress.  They charge you for returns and refuse to refund your purchase until inspection.  They do not do quality checks on their products and shipped out a damaged dress and would not accept the return.  Even without the damage the fit was really bad.  The customer service is no help and the garments you buy do not look like the ones they show on the website. I can understand that maybe the dress I received was a one off bad make.  But the lack of attempt to provide any support shows how they really do business.  I've lost over 200$ and will never buy again from House of CB	2018-04-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ae082e06d33bc0320939164	-0.26666666666666666	negative	["dress", "ive", "charge", "shipping", "pick", "attempt", "really", "bad", "buy", "absolute"]
8534	houseofcb	Jamie	Terrible!!! I ordered a dress which I paid £5.99 next day postage for so my bill came to £144.99 I decided I did not like the dress on so sent this back (I was aware at my own cost) for £11. A couple of days later I received the refund for £133 that was £6 short of what I originally paid. So all in all I have paid £22.99 to try on a dress.It is only £6 but its the principle imagine if 1000 people a day send a dress back for refund  who have paid postage both ways and not free shipping  they are earning a nice little £6000 on top profit for no reason.I can kind of understand this on items that was sent free shipping but for it to apply to orders that the person has paid the postage both ways is just disgusting!	2018-04-25	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ae04f066d33bc0b90faaa63	0.05514705882352941	neutral	["paid", "dress", "postage", "day", "sent", "back", "refund", "ways", "free", "shipping"]

8539	houseofcb	Mike Davies	I purchased a jacket that was £10 off the full price in October last year along with a dress .Loved the dress the jacket was horrible like a leather style that had a really strong horrible smell and felt like cardboard so I sent the jacket back I pulled it out looked smelt it and put it straight back in the box and returned that day.Because it's in the 'sale' (which I think mistress rocks gives a small discount so they don't refund you) I got a £69 credit note for mistress rocks not house of cb as I purchased from mistress rocks. Well they don't have all the items on the mistress rocks website as house of cb do they a few pieces of the stock hardly ever update it and have loads of sale items old horrible stock. I can't spend my £69 on there so they get to keep my money?? Wouldn't even be so bad if I could use it in house of cb or in there store but only to be able to use it on mistress rocks is impossible as they don't update there stock often also it's not legal to offer a different policy on sale items to full price items here in the U.K. Even if selling from America.! You have to offer someone a full refund on distance selling laws if they have cancelled the order iwithin 14days  as it was which i have as I sent it back the same day it arrived. I want my money returned rather sitting in there bank they must have hundreds of thousands of people's money on credit notes. When every other business has to refund there customer within a time period under the distance selling laws.! You can't find an email address to email them you can only fill in a returns form. Clever because then you have no sent email to prove you have contacted them.! Personally I would recommend not ordering from there website as what they do under distance selling is not legal. I only bought something understanding that if it's not what it looked like or does not fit you.! You can return it for a full refund. I will fill in the returns form today and if I don't hear back I will be reporting and opening a claim with the ombudsmen tomorrow. I wouldn't recommend mistress rocks especially if the items are in the sale you may as well go and throw your money down the drain!! I have also just to Dm on twitter and they don't take direct messages because they know what they do is not legal so obviously don't want them.!!I have seen your reply and also replied to you. Whether it states this information or not in the uk the distance selling laws give you a right to cancel.! I did cancel I sent the item back the reason was is because it was an faux leather biker jacket that had the most horrendous smell to it I couldn't have worn it I didn't even try it on I returned it straight away like I said in the reply I may have found it easier to spend a credit note in store where there is not only more options than your mistress Rocks website or even on the house of cb website. Mistress Rocks don't have anywhere near as much stuff on there website so I have found it impossible to spend a credit note with you.! I don't understand why you can have different rules to people selling in the uk.! I would not order anything from your website unless I am 100% certain it's going to be ok but unless I see the item that's unlikely I am going to know hence why I probably won't be using your website for clothes again and it's a shame I have 4 house of cb dresses that I loved just a shame I can't find anything to order on the mistress rocks website would be better if they had all that house of cb does.!!	2018-04-12	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5acf185e6d33bc0a24fe1514	-0.005944749694749674	neutral	["mistress", "rocks", "dont", "website", "house", "selling", "back", "items", "jacket", "full"]
8540	houseofcb	Jenna Richards	I received a faulty dress from this company. The dress was covered in greasy/white finger marks. After complaining promptly and supplying evidence, I was told that these were simply ‘fold lines’ and I could take the dress to go and get dry cleaned at my own cost. Firstly, I have never seen finger print shaped fold lines. Secondly, I would not expect to purchase a brand new dress and need to have it immediately cleaned - at my own cost too. How cheeky!I refused this and insisted on a replacement. I had to send the dress back at my own cost, £11 and a replacement was finally granted. The team made me feel like they were doing me a favour and that I’d be lucky on this occasion to receive a replacement. The return postage cost was never refunded to me even though there was clear fault with the dress. The new dress arrived mark free although I’d assume they would have been ‘folded’ in the same way? Absolutely laughable. Overall left out of pocket and the continuous customer service back and fourth was tedious to say the least.	2018-03-30	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5abe91676d33bc08ec86fb2c	0.08133608815426997	neutral	["dress", "cost", "replacement", "finger", "fold", "lines", "cleaned", "never", "would", "new"]

I’m an XS usually and the size was definitely not true to size. I returned my order and received my refund fairly quickly, however they refusing to refund my original delivery charge which I think is fair considering I had to paid to return the dress as well. Under distance selling regulations I’m owed this back, in their T&Cs it says nothing about not refunding original delivery charge. Just a way of pocketing customers money probably won’t shop here again now.	2018-03-13	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5aa78e2ed5a5700d445821ce	0.14479166666666665	neutral	["size", "order", "dress", "refund", "original", "delivery", "charge", "made", "incoming", "wedding"]

They wouldn’t accept returns (as they should by law) for an exchange (which I would’ve accepted) or a refund..... I am a reasonable girl.

8545	houseofcb	Katie	Following my below review, I felt that I had been treat unacceptably. I sent an unworn item back with the label attached which was faulted. They sent it back to me repaired even though I told the company I did not want the item.Sensibly, I you had a faulted item that even had been worn an ethical company who complied with consumer standards and cared about their customers at all would refund this. But not HouseofCB.I have requested to speak to 'management' who have been consistently involved in the decision but however will not speak to customers directly. Instead you have to deal with an array of nonchalant customer service advisors really seemed inexperienced in dealing with upset customers. It is all really strange.If you like nice clothes and expect not only to be treat not only fairly, but inline with your legislative rights save yourself the bother and don't shop here. The company seem to have it's own ideas on how to operate which is so far away from acceptable and responsible that I wouldn't want to associate with their clothing in future.If you do have an issue please do inform the Ombudsman who will be able to support you theretailombusdman.comThanks	2018-02-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a8fd5f5d27b0a0520753d19	0.20882352941176474	neutral	["company", "customers", "treat", "sent", "item", "back", "faulted", "even", "want", "speak"]
8546	houseofcb	Morgane Tchekouteff	DO NOT ORDERI ordered 3 pieces in sale.They didn't fit well so I had to send them back.On the website FAQ page this is mentioned:"Sale items: Sale items can only be returned for refund by credit note."So I send it back on my expense.Now I received an email mentioning "the refund is not accepted" because it was a 3 for 2 sale. HOW THE HELL CAN I NOW THESE SIZES ARE BAD? I DON'T LIVE IN THE UK??!!!So, I wasted my money on the 3 useless pieces AND on the shipping cost back. This is the worst service EVER. So I repeat... DO NOT ORDER HERE.Your order will only go fine if it fits and you want to keep it. Otherwise, you're screwed.	2018-02-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a8d96d6d27b0a052074a4ff	-0.1315426997245179	negative	["pieces", "send", "items", "sale", "refund", "back", "order", "orderi", "ordered", "salethey"]

Delivery guy came at 9.40 am and DID NOT VEN TRY TO DELIVER OR KNOCK THE DOOR OR RING THE BELL EVEN THOUGH MY DOOR NUMBER AND PHONE NUMBER WAS CLEARLY GIVEN. He LEFT a note under the door mentioning my parcel was at Post Office at Malabar Road, Leicester. I am a very busy person and usually not able to pick items up as post office closes by the time i finish work. The following week I went to the post office and THE ITEM WAS NOT THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I called parcel force and they said that the parcel was never sent to the post office so clearly this was a lie on the card left behind by the postman (I HAVE PROOF). Parcelforce then said they'd redeliver on Monday 19 February. Item STILL HAS NOT ARRIVED. i called parcel force and THEY SEEM TO HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE REDELIVERY THEY HAVE OFFERED JUST LAST WEEK. I HAVE EMAILED HOUSEOFCB SEVERAL TIMES AND ALL YOU SAID WAS TO WAIT FOR THE DELIVERY! WHAT JOKE! LOUSY COMPPANY AND LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE! BEWARE!

8548	houseofcb	hannah bowley	Poor customer service, very misleading returns - says in returns they will accept anything back unworn so i returned a bodysuit which was unworn with tags and hygiene label intact same day that i received (cup size was ridiculously small and im only a b cup).  Bearing in mind this came with a hygiene label and a returns label i tried this on over underwear to discover its a poor fit for someone that is a box standard medium in everything and returned straight away.  They wont accept the returns back and have sent it back to me (oh yeh you have to pay for your returns too massive joke).  Dont waste your money - shop at figleaves their customer service is great and they accept returns.	2018-02-13	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a8332b0d27b0a0a1440263e	0.02333333333333333	neutral	["returns", "accept", "back", "label", "poor", "customer", "service", "unworn", "returned", "hygiene"]
8549	houseofcb	RachC	I’ve shopped many times with House of CB and find the clothes and shoes stunning and beautifully packaged! The few times I’ve had to contact customer services I’ve found them to be helpful and accommodating! My only gripe is that if you need to return something, they deduct £6 from your refund and you have to pay to return your item! I feel that as a large company that you could cover at least one of these costs! I know that it’s in your T&C’s but to expect your customers to have to pay twice to return something is unfair especially as if you exchange then you ship out again for free! I can’t think of any other company that deducts money from refunds to cover their own costs! Other than that, like I said , the actual clothes are gorgeous, well made and I always feel really special in one of your dresses! 18/01/2019 happy to hear that House of Cb no longer deduct money from your refund if you need to return an item, would still go here first if I need a dress for a special occasion the designs are beautiful, very well made structured and fit amazing!	2018-02-12	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a81c859d27b0a0594cc7a97	0.2975155279503106	neutral	["return", "need", "times", "house", "clothes", "something", "deduct", "refund", "pay", "item"]

8551	houseofcb	Clara Raffo	After reading all these reviews I was really worried as a dress I’d paid £160 for had become faulty and completely unwearable. I contacted house of cb about the dress and received quick responses everytime. I was asked to send the dress back for inspection and to be honest I wasn’t overly hopeful about getting my money back or anything.Today I received an email to say I was getting a refund for the full amount. No fuss at all. The customer services representatives were polite and friendly. I’m so happy with the service. I’m a loyal customer of house of cb and after this I’ll continue to be! The money I got refunded is getting spent on another house of cb dress as soon as it hits my bank!Thank you xx	2018-02-09	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a7dd2edd27b0a0594cba79c	0.27954545454545454	neutral	["dress", "house", "getting", "received", "back", "money", "customer", "reading", "reviews", "really"]

8553	houseofcb	David Sense	I ordered a dress in a small, received an email stating they had no smalls left and asked if I would take a medium. I agreed to try a medium under the impression I could return the item if it were too large. The dress was huge and I received no refund slip with the item. Upon emailing them for one I was told this item is not allowed to be refunded or exchanged. I feel this is very unfair as if the item had been a small (like I had ordered originally) and their website had been updated correctly I wouldn't have wasted my money. I won't be buying anymore through them, plenty of other websites offering similar dresses etc and I have since even noticed the exact same items being sold on Alibaba for a FRACTION of the cost.	2018-01-23	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a6688bc6116dd0f642f8ee4	-0.019642857142857153	neutral	["item", "ordered", "dress", "small", "received", "medium", "email", "stating", "smalls", "left"]
8554	houseofcb	LS	**Update***Mistress Rocks confirmed that they went ahead and refunded the shipping costs for the order back to my card. I just wish that it didn't cause so much friction and several back and forth e-mails. I have updated this rating to 3 stars from 1 star. Thank you! ***********************************************I shop House of CB and have been satisfied with their service and clothing. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case with their sister company Mistress Rocks. I made my first purchase which was for a vegan (faux) leather jacket that was on sale. As soon as the package arrived and I opened it, there was a faulty smell that was coming from the jacket. It was as though someone smeared aged cheese all over the jacket it was unbearable. I immediately contacted customer service and advised them of the issue and asked to be provided with a return label as this is not acceptable. Bonnie responded and asked for me to send the jacket back and to e-mail them a copy of the postage receipt which I did. It took over a week of back and forth because they initially refused to provide me with a full refund stating that although the jacket had a foul odor, there was no damage to it and I could have aired it out. I responded and said that Bonnie could have advised me to air out the jacket when I e-mailed her as to what the issue was and I could have tried that first to see if it worked. Also, you should have noted in the description that the jacket wreaks of a bad odor and here are the steps to take to remove the odor. What makes them think I want to hang a piece of clothing in my closet only for the smell to transfer over to other clothing? They finally agreed to refund the cost of the jacket but not the shipping costs. I guess in their world, consumers here in the US just wants to pay for shipping to receive a jacket made of material so cheap that it wreaks of bad odor and the pay for shipping to send the item back. Because I have nothing better to do with my money. I even said that I am fine if they want to issue the refund of the jacket back to my card and I will take either shipping costs back as store credit and they still refused to do that. I have since filed a claim with my credit card company in order to receive the full refund back and have provided them with the e-mail communication of them admitting that the item indeed has an odor. That is no way to do business at all.	2018-01-19	3	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a61e07b6116dd0d6474ba7c	0.06178160919540233	neutral	["jacket", "back", "shipping", "odor", "refund", "costs", "card", "clothing", "issue", "could"]
8555	houseofcb	Isabella Beaton-Hind	If you plan on returning anything to houseofcb GOOD LUCK as they do not follow the basic laws stated in the consumer rights act!!!DO NOT PURCHASE their Tahnia dress. The crystals on it constantly catch on itself leaving totally embarrassing pulls and threads all over the dress after wearing it for only a few hours to dinner!!! I tried to return this dress to them asking for a refund or store credit, I would have been happy to take a different style dress as in the past I have been perfectly happy with the brand. However they declined my request and sent me a replacement dress. I then explained to them that I refuse to pay £199 for a dress that is clearly UNFIT FOR PURPOSE and that it is actually my LEGAL right under the consumer rights act to a refund. After also explaining and sending proof that a friend of mine purchased the SAME dress with the SAME issue and received a credit note, they continued to DECLINE my request due to "management refusal"!!Their inexperienced customer service team sent me this UNACCEPTABLE reply, therefore leaving me with no choice but to take them to the consumer ombudsman and file a claim with the small claims court: "Hi Isabella,Thanks for your email. I am sorry we aren't able to fulfill  your request this time.

8558	houseofcb	Nasreen Analouei	I never leave bad reviews, ever. The one and only time I placed an order through HouseofCB has been a nightmare. I ordered a dress which arrived on 12/28/17. After trying the dress on it didnt work for my body. The ribbon was left on and I paid $26.95 to return the dress via USPS on 12/29/17. Less than 24 hours after I got it. The tracking number shows the dress was delivered to the Las Vegas address on 1/2/18. I used the address provided on the packing slip. I have been emailing with thier sales@houseofcb and theyre giving me the run around. No refund, no help. Theyre telling me to check with the shipping carrier. The tracking information on USPS is very clear. I have emailed with Noel, Nikki, and Lucila. This was the last email from Nikki." Hi thereThank you for email. I do understand your worries but I do apologize as we are unable to process a refund / an exchange if we have not received the returned goods. Can I suggest to do a follow up with your entrusted delivery carrier for further information ? Warm regardsNikki"Please do not waste your money here. It looks as though I will be fighting a long battle with them to get my refund and I'm willing to wait as long as it takes.UPDATE:1/15/18 12:30pm EST Maria M responded to this review asking for the tracking and order number.

They keep promising to refund my money, however, two weeks later and no refund. To make things worse, instead of refunding me the 105 dollars for the dress, they  have charged me three weeks later for the original order again... $369x2. I’ve emailed like crazy and sent the requested copy of my bank statement where I was charged twice instead of being refunded. This is insane, especially considering how much they charge for their clothes. I will never order from them again, nor any company that doesn’t offer a phone number for customer service.

The store assistant assured me the manager believed there was enough time to order a new card.Upon returning the dress today following the holidays, they have refused.

8565	houseofcb	susie	I have not ordered anything from here & never would but their online returns policy for their £45 “promo” is illegal. By law when you buy online consumers have the right to return within 14 days for a refund . The consumer contracts regulations means online purchases whether they are on sale or not can be returned. House of cb clearly trying to deceive customers & take advantage of people who are unaware of this. Also if anyone buys from here I would advise you buy with a credit card especially if it is over £100 as gives you extra protection under section 75.

However, when tracking the parcel it says they sent us ‘access instructions’, they havent responded to an email asking for an update and they do not state their courier so i am clueless as to whether i will get the dress in time.

8567	houseofcb	N	I have never written a review for a company and I have previously been a fan of house of cb and bought several items from their store, but their online customer service is terrible.I received dresses which were evidently faulty and after returning the dresses weeks ago, I still do not have a refund despite several emails. The excuses are laughable from waiting weeks for the inspection to take place to now having to wait for their management to reply. My advice is do not order from house of cb online! You will not receive good customer service. By contrast, I returned an item to Asos 3 days ago and have already received a refund, therefore the Christmas period can not be used as an excuse! This company's customer service absolutely do not reflect the high end brand they are trying to portray, which is a shame!

8569	houseofcb	Becca Allen	Honestly one of the worst customer service i have ever received....or not received in this case!I purchased a Zana dress from House of CB for £119, £59 on credit note and the other £60 on debit card.The dress that was meant to be delivered 2-3 working days took 11 days meaning the dress could not be used for my Christmas party. when this arrive it had a stain down the front, the neck clasp was sown out of line and the overall dress quality was completely awful.I then have emailed the sales team about my complaint and only requested that I have my money back and my credit note. I have been back and forth with this email as they are only giving me a full credit note back, even though the dress was faulty and their website says that they offer refund on their website!This has to be one of the worst companies I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with, I feel appalled that I have paid £119 for a dress that standard is of what a 5 year could make.Something needs to be done!	2017-12-21	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a3bc980a5b3290f74600f0c	-0.14565972222222223	negative	["dress", "credit", "note", "back", "one", "worst", "ever", "\\u00a3119", "days", "could"]
8570	houseofcb	Smith	I ordered from mistress rocks over a week ago and have not been sent any tracking Info, so I went onto their website to find out where my parcel was, they have their own tracking page but for days mine has said awaiting dispatch and nothing has changed. Since they claim to have 2-3 day delivery I think this is ridicolous. I have emailed them multiple times and I am still waiting on a reply. I am very dissapointed and have never experienced customer service this awful.	2017-12-17	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a36c85fa5b3290064714048	-0.12	negative	["tracking", "ordered", "mistress", "rocks", "week", "ago", "sent", "info", "went", "onto"]
8571	houseofcb	Melissa Tobar	I ordered a dress from Mistress Rocks, online it looked good but once I received it it was sheer- not was I was looking for. I returned it with ALL the tags, no damage unworn as they specify for a full refund. I received an email stating a "gift certificate" had been activated. I then reached out to customer service who advised they would not be returning money to my card but giving me a certificate to shop with them again. That is not what I want, I want MY MONEY BACK. Not to mention how aggravating it is to have to wait 1-2 days for a response via email every time. Its been over  a week of emails back & forth for simple questions and a conversation over the phone that could take 5 minutes.I asked numerous times for a PHONE NUMBER so I could speak with a supervisor/manager & the request was not even acknowledged. I was told the "T&C" stated all "sale" items to be refunded by credit note. First of all what is T&C, I don't work for y'all I don't know your acronyms. Second, this is the first time I ever hear of a "credit note". Please return my money. I don't want to shop. The dress was for a formal event, for which I had to find another dress and your dress was never used as you could tell by that extra long "tag" that was attached.	2017-12-13	2	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a31624fa5b3290a603d0d32	0.12499999999999999	neutral	["dress", "money", "want", "could", "dont", "received", "email", "certificate", "shop", "back"]

8574	houseofcb	Lucinda	I bought a black mesh top as well as some other items spending over £200 in mistress rocks. The black top dye covered my entire back, beddding as well as the other clothes I purchased which I have not been able to wear as the black dye ran onto them. When I contacted mistress rocks they told me to return the black top to them making sure I covered the postage costs then when they received my return they will not refund me nor the postage costs. And all they have offered me is a credit note for the one top. I do not want a credit note for this top, all I want is my money back which sums to over £200 plus shipping costs involved. I am so sad and thrustrated with this company so please anyone reading this don’t buy from them!Also, I ordered a 2 piece from house of cb wore it twice and went all bobbly which it shouldn’t because it’s advertised as “100% cotton”. So when I contacted them they made me send it back to them for an analysis which again I had to pay for the postage costs then after a few weeks they say there’s nothing wrong with it and return it to the wrong address. They said it was my fault because I did not confirm my shipping address but they didn’t allow me enough time to respond. They won’t do anything about it so please people save your money and shop elsewhere. This company is nothing but greedy and does not care about its customers at all. The sickening thing is the owner made over 9 million profit this year and yet the companies have the worst customer service. I really don’t know how it survives.

They didn't want to refund me £79 as it was a sale item so I was forced to purchase.  When I finaly found something I liked they asked me to buy gift voucher for £50 to reach the money purchase. Unfortunately my husband bought me that dress already so had to return it. It was NOT on sale nut they still refuse to refund me. Now they are holding on to my £129 and what ever im trying to buy isnt in my size or is restocking. Rubbish company will never deal with them again.	2017-11-29	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a1e67ba04017d03f4c4bd45	0.0074074074074074	neutral	["dress", "bought", "restocking", "something", "didnt", "refund", "sale", "purchase", "buy", "massive"]
8576	houseofcb	JAYNE BRIDGE	I agree with all the reviews - terrible customer service.  I went in tonight to buy a body suit I had my eye on for 3 weeks cost of £89. I went in and picked up the top up and took it to the till.  I asked for a new one to be told they had none in stock.  Yes they said we will shop order and send to your home free of charge.  I then went to pay to be told it was £129 ! The ticket was clearly £89 and had been every time I went in.  She then said it had gone up in price.  How can a top go from 89 to 129!!.  After much complain8ng her manger said he would honour the price but it was classed as a sale item and I could not exchange or return.  His was a new in store £89 top and I had to pay postage.  The manager of the store was too busy to come and see me.  This store was MANCHESTER .  I will never shop here again knowing they increase prices- who does that,  company must think we are stupid:  total disgrace.

No number to contact them on.  The returns label indicated I had to send the return item back to las vegas which I did at a cost of £13.  they keep emailing me im at fault and I should have sent the item back to a depot in the UK.  I still have no answer of how they will solve that issue.   The dress cost £90. I have spoken to trading standards because they are registered out of the EU consumer regulations do not apply.  so be becareful. Now they are telling I can not get a refund for the item because it was on sale.  the dont care about consumer rights just pure profit.  They want to give me a credit note forcing me to spend on their site.  Its my choice I want my money back which they are refusing. I have spent over £2000 on House of CB products instore and on the site but never ever again. Three weeks down the line I have no refund no credit note no answers I am out of pocket.

8585	houseofcb	Lisa M	My partner purchased a dress for me to wear on my 30th birthday (Coco Satin Drape Dress) for £109 the dress was poorly stitched near the zip and was not made properly so the whole zip area was sticking out on the side of the dress. We sent an email to Customer Services and was asked to send photos which we did after 5 working days we received a reply saying that the photos will be sent to Management for them to make a decision, a further 3 working days later we were asked to send the dress back (we explained that I would need the dress for my birthday which was in 5 days. We then received an email 2 days later saying that they acknowledge the faulty dress and have sent me a replacement dress. My replacement dress arrived just in time a day before my birthday. To my horror this dress had the exact same fault plus a rip above the zip. I couldn't believe that they would send me another faulty dress. I realised that I would need to give up on wearing this dress as My birthday was the next day so I requested a refund. I emailed them and had to go through the same process and pay to return the dress for a 2nd time. As usual they were slow and unhelpful and I had to chase them up 3 times for an amswer, eventually they emailed me back saying that they can't see any fault with the dress but as a goodwill gesture they had sent me out a replacement dress. I emailed them back explaining my birthday had been and that there is clearly a fault with the design of this dress and requested a full refund which I am entitled to according to the CONSUMER RIGHTS ACT 2015. I was refused a refund and told that my dress was on it's way. I am still trying to get my money back from this company and may have to take them to a small claims court. My whole experience with House of CB has been a complete NIGHTMARE from start to finish! I really do not understand how they are still trading with such awful policies, poor quality and outrageous customer services. The only advise I can offer anyone thinking of purchasing from House of CB is AVOID AT ALL COSTS, NO MATTER HOW TEMPTED YOU ARE THE CHANCES ARE YOU WILL REGRET IT!	2017-07-24	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5976213cfba87f08a823456f	-0.07916666666666666	neutral	["dress", "birthday", "sent", "days", "back", "zip", "send", "saying", "would", "replacement"]

8587	houseofcb	Louise	I had been a loyal customer for years until this experience:Bought a dress, when it came it was covered in shiny marks like it had been ironed. I immediately emailed the company the asked me to send pictures and before I even sent them they said it'll be press marks. I sent said pics and they emailed back to say they were press marks. I sent the dress back at my own expense, then they refunded me the dress minus their shopping cost of £6 and refused to pay me for my delivery costs! What this company is doing is completely illegal under the consumer rights act and this dress was unfit for purpose! They even told me to go and get the dress dry cleaned at my own expenses! Not once did they offer to exchange the dress for another one without marks. I spoke to the citizens advice about this and this was their reply:I have just spoken to the citizens advice and they have advised me that under the consumer rights act the goods were not of a satisfactory quality as the cane marked. I am in my right to ask you for the goods to be put into the original position and that you should of uplifted them from the place of delivery! Are you part of an ADR scheme? If not I will be taking you to a small claims court as ok well within my rights. This company are bullies and I will not stand for it! For the sake of delivery costs they've lost a customer! I'm absolutely disgusted by the way they've treated me. It's not even about the money it's the principal. It seems I'm not the only one!I have emailed them over 40 times and I get the same response of: the goods were not faulty and a dry clean would of got the stains out (dry clean at my own expense) Please think twice about using this company!I will be taking them to a small claims court to recover my money and I really hope other people push the consumer rights act on them!

I purchased two products a skirt and top on one invoice, however I noticed that they were being shipped seperately, thus I was being charged twice for import fees one being $18.99 and the other $40. It was an exorbitant amount to pay on products that I purchased together. If buying multiple products equates in multiple shipments and duty fees that needs to be explicitly stated on the website. The website indicates that this company uses UPS, however I  received a delievery from FedEx as well! I need to be compensated for the extra funds that I was forced to spend as the website failed to adequately state that it was a possibility--in allllll that these folks had 5 different people tell me that they were going to seek out management...2 months later nothing!

I am pretty satisfied overall with my two purchases however, the i noticed in the front around the chest area that taupe bandage dress had a bit of discoloring? It is faint but i do notice it a little bit, almost like it was lighter bleached stain? i mean.. not severe as that, it is small but i notice it which bothers me. I tried it in natural outside light and indoors in my bathroom. I really might be how the material was dyed. I'm a little worried to get it dry cleaned because what if the spot comes much more apparent? For the most part i am happy with my purchases. Feels and wears like good material. True to size fit. The shipping was very fast and they packaged it well ( in a nice blue flat dress box and individually tissue wrapped. I'll probably be repurchasing from company again. Better than the quality of fashion nova(sorry! just being honest) Obviously there's a big price difference and it shows in quality, but you can be the judge of that ;)	2017-01-27	4	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/588bce9b84557309d0d18f7d	0.213406862745098	neutral	["dress", "fast", "taupe", "bandage", "purchases", "bit", "notice", "little", "like", "material"]

8599	houseofcb	Teresa Miah	I always shop on house of cb.. on the day it came out new stock I sat nude pearl bodysuit and skirt .. at £189 each not cheap I ordered immediately Waited a week for it and then this morning I get an email saying my bodysuit got water damage in transit .. so il get a refund?? I don't want a refund... I want the item!! There's no number to call ., juSt an address to email so I messaged .. got no response .. then tnite at the very end of the day I get another email saying the matching skirt I ordered got water damaged in transit?? What liars!! More like they gave my order to someone else etc... so it seems if you buy their items as soon as come out .. and even if you're good customers they don't care!! They've left my daughter who I was buying it for very disappointed.. and aren't bothered! Total joke of a company!!!	2016-12-06	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5846f1bc02db9b0b44f2f816	0.07954545454545453	neutral	["get", "email", "got", "day", "bodysuit", "skirt", "ordered", "saying", "water", "transit"]

8601	houseofcb	Laura	Having ordered a number of dresses from Celeb Boutique over the years I have never been disappointed. The quality has always been excellent and the delivery has always been fast.Also if I ever return a dress the refund/exchange is dealt with very quickly.	2016-09-05	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/57cd37bb0000ff000983e1e9	0.22777777777777777	neutral	["always", "ordered", "number", "dresses", "celeb", "boutique", "years", "never", "disappointed", "quality"]
8602	houseofcb	ANON	First time ordering on HouseofCB after trying on some dresses in store to get an idea of sizing. The one I saw online wasn't in store so I went back online to order it. It came the next day in a perfect box, perfectly wrapped and the dress was beautiful but even the XS was slightly too big on me. So sad I had to return it but they refunded my money within a couple of days. \nLuckily I ordered two more dresses from their sister company (Mistress Rocks) at the same time. This came the day after the HouseofCB arrived. I kept one and returned the other. Mistress Rocks also refunded the money within a couple of days. \n\nThe only downside I would say is that I had to pay for returns which is fine but the dresses are quite heavy and since I had to return one dress to each company, it cost me something like £5 for one dress and £6 for the another - whereas several other companies offer free returns. BUT the dress I kept was beautiful, perfect fit and I had lots of compliments when I wore it so I guess the extra effort was worth it!	2015-12-09	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/566821060000ff0009229d1e	0.2607638888888889	neutral	["one", "dress", "dresses", "time", "houseofcb", "store", "online", "came", "day", "perfect"]
8603	houseofcb	Star	I received a damaged jacket with a stain on the sleeve. I had not even take it out of the box as I could see all the tissue paper and paperwork all scrunched up. I instantly emailed CS with my photos with security tags still in place, just to make sure they didn't say that I had worn it or anything like that. They took ages to get back to me and just told me this as if it was my fault. How can a fcuking stain be a  manufacturing fault? \n\n"I am very sorry that there seems to be an issue with your order. As we are not able to access your item  properly , can I suggest to return it  back for an inspection first ? \n\nWe are more than happy to accept your item back for an exchange / refund once your item is confirm to have manufacturing faults. Please follow the instructions on the return slip (enclosed) and return your item  back to us as soon as possible. Please don't forget to include the reason you have returned the item  and that an inspection is required. This will make it easier for our return team. Please retain a copy of your postage receipt for future reference. \n\nI hope this helps and if there is anything else you need, please let me know. I am happy to help. Thank you. "\n\n\nI had many red flags before e.g I could pay with my cards as I tried 5 times and they rejected payment. Nothing to do with my bank or my high funds but because I used my card more than 5 times in a row in a short space of time. So what will they do when it come to Christmas? \n\nAlso orders ship from China so just imagine the real value and to what you have paid.  They have no telephone SC but what left me feeling angered is that they avoid taking any responsibility when they send out DAMAGES GOODS.\n\nI will not be buying from them ever again because of this. They can seem me a a lost customer $$$	2015-08-12	1	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/55cbba2e0000ff0002feaf55	0.11130434782608697	neutral	["item", "back", "return", "please", "stain", "could", "make", "anything", "fault", "manufacturing"]
8604	houseofcb	Steve Lloyd	My daughter Katie, bought a dress for her 18th birthday from an online boutique store but, when it arrived she was very disappointed. \n\nShe went onto the houseofcb.com website and ordered a lovely red bodycon dress. IT arrived within 24 hours and was absolutely amazing. \n\nIt was a little bit more money than the first one she ordered but there was no comparison in the quality of the outfit or the way that it fitted.  \n\nShe has bought several outfits since including a lovely bandage dress and several accessories.	2014-11-03	5	https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/545739230000640002b0ebfa	0.11875	neutral	["dress", "bought", "arrived", "ordered", "lovely", "several", "daughter", "katie", "18th", "birthday"]
