Satin is known to mark easily under pressure, and the fabric used offers no tolerance for standard trying-on.\n\nThe size 12 is also labelled ‚Äúlarge‚Äù but fits more like a 10. I‚Äôm a true 12 and rarely have sizing issues.\n\nTrying something on to assess fit is a legal right. If a dress becomes unsellable from being tried on once, it‚Äôs not fit for purpose.

    "review": "Firstly, I absolutely LOVE my Sabrina dress!! I bought it for a wedding guest outfit and felt soooo gorgeous in it! I had so many complements! My original dress arrived with some minor marks on it, so I emailed customer services and Gary was there to assist. He immediately offered me a replacement, I just had to return my item and show the proof of postage and a new one was shipped to me with next day delivery (the wedding was in a matter of days so I made some requests i.e. not having to wait for them to receive the dress before shipping my replacement, and for it to be sent next day), and Gary was super helpful in making this possible! He also personally checked my replacement item before shipping, to check it was perfect! Thanks a lot Gary, and Wanderdoll for the gorgeous dress!",

Had to pay a lot of import duties - receive the dress, open it, and there is a huge defect/stain on the top. I write including photos, all tags and ribbon still attached, just opened it. They just simply say, I ironed it and that's why it happened, nothing to do about it. WOW. Honestly, I think it's a 16 year old child, trying to sell dresses. DO NOT BUY HERE! Never, ever, will I buy again on such a shitty website.\n\nAs below you can see, they blame the customer. I received it, opened it and saw the stain. Imagine being this customer and they blame you. Horrible horrible horrible company. Waist of money and time!",
