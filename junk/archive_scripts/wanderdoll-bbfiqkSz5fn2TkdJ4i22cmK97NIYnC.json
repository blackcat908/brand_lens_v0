    "review": "Ordered the Yris dress in white. It came and was see-through, as well as having a very odd extra bit of material on the shoulder which looked like a badly manufactured hiccup. I then received a gift card from them when I returned it, despite choosing ‚Äúrefund back to original payment method‚Äù when creating the return. I contacted them, and was told that ‚ÄúFC‚Äù on the product name meant final call which means no refund given, only gift card. They expect their customers to know that the abbreviation meant that. I asked them to show in my account original order email confirmation, where it says that it was final call, and they weren‚Äôt able to show this to me, just keep highlighting the ‚ÄúFC‚Äù on their website. I‚Äôm not sure why I ordered from them, as I‚Äôve ordered a total of 3 times now and have always had to return due to poor manufacturing or material. It is convenient that a dress which shows your full seamless underwear, is under ‚ÄúFC‚Äù meaning customers will never be reimbursed. Their customer service advisor was also very patronising and rude in his last email; he could not show me the terms and conditions in my screenshot I sent of my original email, but kept advising me I ‚Äúclearly‚Äù agreed to this by checking out.",

    "review": "I bought the ARIA Maxi Dress in a size 12. It went on easily but was impossible to take off without help. The poor construction means the dress can‚Äôt be removed without placing it under stress. I wasn‚Äôt wearing makeup, tan, or body products, and filmed the struggle to remove it.\n\nWander Doll refused my return, citing ‚Äúmarks‚Äù on the satin ‚Äî but the photos they provided show normal creases and folds, not product transfer or damage. Satin is known to mark easily under pressure, and the fabric used offers no tolerance for standard trying-on.\n\nThe size 12 is also labelled ‚Äúlarge‚Äù but fits more like a 10. I‚Äôm a true 12 and rarely have sizing issues.\n\nTrying something on to assess fit is a legal right. If a dress becomes unsellable from being tried on once, it‚Äôs not fit for purpose. I‚Äôve escalated this with Klarna and Trading Standards and would advise others to be cautious before buying.",

My original dress arrived with some minor marks on it, so I emailed customer services and Gary was there to assist. He immediately offered me a replacement, I just had to return my item and show the proof of postage and a new one was shipped to me with next day delivery (the wedding was in a matter of days so I made some requests i.e. not having to wait for them to receive the dress before shipping my replacement, and for it to be sent next day), and Gary was super helpful in making this possible! He also personally checked my replacement item before shipping, to check it was perfect! Thanks a lot Gary, and Wanderdoll for the gorgeous dress!",

Never, ever, will I buy again on such a shitty website.\n\nAs below you can see, they blame the customer. I received it, opened it and saw the stain. Imagine being this customer and they blame you.

When I received the dress, it did not have the tags or ribbons attached, which I assumed was an oversight during the packing process. The dress was also too big for me, so I never wore it.

However, when I tried to return it, I was informed that they couldn't accept the return because the item was missing its tags and ribbons. This is extremely frustrating, especially because those items were never included with the dress in the first place. It's clear to me that they are using the return policy as a way to avoid issuing refunds.

I find this to be a dishonest practice and feel cheated by the company's refusal to process a return, despite the fact that the dress was in unworn condition. The dress was an expensive purchase, and the company is clearly using unfair tactics to keep money while providing no resolution for the customer.

I would not recommend this company to anyone. Buyer beware ‚Äì their "return policy" seems like a scam to avoid issuing refunds!

The material of the dress is very delicate.\n\nI emailed the company and sent photos they requested.\n\nThe company inform me that they have checked CCTV and QR information and this black dress was sent without scratches.\n\nThey were 100% sure of this I asked for evidence of this information.\n\nI infact reassured them that I loved the dress and would prefer an exchange.\n\nThey took no accountability and was willing to argue back and forth to assure me that an exchange or return will not be accepted.\n\nThe person behind customer service is argumentative and perhaps need a course to be taken on management & customer service.\n\nNo proof or evidence was provided and in fact they didn‚Äôt respond to my email.\n\nI‚Äôm in shock and hope that they will see this review and take action with their customer service delivery.\n\nI rate -5!\n\nTerrible",

    "review": "Do not buy from this company. BBX Brand do a great job of marketing and advertising their products, thats a fact. But their dresses are far from worth the money you pay for them. When I received my dress it smelt horrible, the sizing was awful, the material is cheap, the stitching is awful and it was just a crazy experience from start to now.\n\nAs an ONLINE retailer, UK consumer law overwrites their policies as they are an online retailer, if there is an issue with their products, especially when they are not as advertised. I sent back 2 dresses which were of awful quality and not as described and they are refusing (going against the LAW) to refund me. Sent me a voucher i‚Äôll never ever use the whole while i‚Äôm breathing! They love to argue their case in email exchanges, with their sarcastic tone.. and even go to lengths of calling you by a different name and putting kisses at the end of their emails‚Ä¶ sooooo sarcastic lol!\n\nTheir customer service skills are far from professional, and whoever is advising them on their policies clearly hasn't done their research on UK law.\n\nPlease make sure, if you do purchase, to use Paypal or Klarna to cover you. As the grief you get from these uneducated individuals is actually tiresome and boring and very repetitive. No doubt some one will comment with a very sarcastic reply on here (queue the drumroll). I‚Äôm just spreading awareness. Do your research first, but I highly discourage anyone from buying from this awful brand.\n\nLuckily I posted this to social media and managed to save a friend from working with them for their marketing and sales side and also save girls from eyeing up their website.

    "review": "Ive had a terrible experience with this company when ordering a dress for my baby shower. There was only a size 12 available, while I usually wear a size 10. I contacted customer service to ask about the lead time and if I could return the dress if it was too big. Knowing exactly which dress I was interested in, they assured me it was returnable. Based on this, I placed the order, thinking I could exchange it for a different size or get my money back if needed.\n\nA few days later, I became concerned after reading reviews on Trustpilot and emailed the company again to confirm their return policy. They then told me the dress was a pre-order item and non-returnable because it was made to order. This made no sense since I couldn't even order a size 10 in the first place. If it were truly made to order, I should have been able to choose any size.\n\nI requested to cancel the order, as it had not yet shipped, but was told I could only get store credit and no refund. When I asked about exchanging the dress, they said I would need to buy another dress and would only get store credit for the original dress, effectively costing me double the price.\n\nIn their last email to me on Monday, they told me I needed to let them know what I wanted to do as the dress was due to ship that day. I replied in a couple of hours to say I will have to keep the dress as clearly I have no other option without being out of pocket. I have received no response and it is now Friday, clearly the dress was never ready to ship.\n\nThis entire experience has been incredibly frustrating and upsetting and now I‚Äôm getting no response from them.\n\nDo not buy from this company. Their policies are unreasonable, and their customer service is appalling",

And the dress looked nothing like the image; if felt much cheaper quality than pictured or priced. I decided to return it immediately to get my refund but to my surprise they don‚Äôt offer refunds on any items bought with a discount code (codes which they send to your inbox as a subscriber to the store). This is not only unfair on a customer but also against the consumer rights acts legislation for online purchase. From speaking with the Trading Standards, this has been escalated to be resolved however it‚Äôs a shame a brand would put so many loopholes to keep customer funds. A reputable brand would have no issue just issuing refunds - unless you anticipate a lot of complaints üòä\n\nThe one pro is how responsive the customer service team are to come back to queries. I don‚Äôt bought if I wanted to exchange my dress they would be able to assist. Unfortunately the quality has put me right off and now stuck in back and forth with them to get my refund back, as legislation permits.",
