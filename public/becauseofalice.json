Some of the items weren‚Äôt in stock to reorder and she asked if I wanted anything similar in their place rather than just cancelling the items. As I placed quite a large order for my upcoming hen do and month long honeymoon (as well as some other things) this was a much better option for me.

They will only issue a refund for the items included in the parcel. I now suggest you check you have not left this item out of your return parcel\nThank you\nLucy\"\n\nNot only is she alluding to the fact that I am still in possession of the 4th item, but this was the last response I got. She had no interest in investigating and asking for proof of postage or anything. ZERO HELP!!!\nI have sent 3 email follow ups today and infact they sent me a blank email as a response.\n\nI paid with Klarna so Im currently trying to get this resolved through them since BOA are acting like a \"scam brand\" - This experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I dont think I will be shopping here anymore since they love to commit daylight robbery and do not care about building trust with their customers. I cannot trust them again.\n\nUpdate: currently raising a report with Klarna.",

A few days later, I contacted BOA again, and this time, they acknowledged that the package seems to be lost. However, I am left with the impression that BOA has taken my money, as Lucy‚Äôs responses have been delayed and unhelpful, with no solution offered regarding either receiving my package or a refund.\n\nThe lack of proper customer service and resolution is unacceptable, and I am extremely disappointed with this entire process. Lucy‚Äôs responses were particularly frustrating, and I feel that my concerns have not been adequately addressed. As of now, I have neither received my order nor a refund, and there has been no clear action taken to rectify the situation.\n\nI hope this message serves as a warning to others, as my experience has been disappointing and unsatisfactory.",

Got a message from Evri on the Sunday saying it was out for delivery. It didn‚Äôt turn up and then got a message saying they attempted delivery. Which they didn‚Äôt. They had attached a blank photo. They then said it was out for delivery on Monday. Again waited all day and it‚Äôs didn‚Äôt show up they again said they had attempted with a blank photo but they hadn‚Äôt. I emailed somebody called Lucy to advise of the issues and that I wanted them to raise a complaint with Evri and get my delivery charge refunded give they had wasted 2 days and lied about attempting delivery. She was apologetic and said she would. It turned up finally late on the Tuesday night. I let Lucy know and asked her to still raise the complaint asking for the delivery charge to be refunded as they have wasted my time and delivered 2 days later than they originally said - as Evri don‚Äôt accept complaints from customers. She assured me she would. Just chased her again over 2 weeks later and she has sent a stock reply to say. ‚ÄòThe order wont have been processed until the next working day I.e Monday??? (When it was out for delivery already on Sunday??) So I wouldn‚Äôt get a refund. No reference at all to my complaint. So clearly she hasn‚Äôt even bothered to raise my complaint. Awful! Why do companies spend time and money on creating a brand and service to then use cowboys like Evri. They don‚Äôt accept complaints from customers If you can‚Äôt be bothered to deal with the complaints on your customers behalf then you need to make this clear when ordering. Order at your own risk. Or change your courier company. I was a first time customer and the quality was good and you had an opportunity to rectify the issues. I would‚Äôve ordered again but I certainly won‚Äôt now.",

After checking their returns portal, I could see that they had in fact received both tops. I shared a screenshot with Lucy confirming the full return but Inever received a reply. After following up multiple times over a couple of weeks, I had to raise a dispute with my credit card provider to get a refund as the brand ghosted my emails.

When I received my order I was disappointed by the sizing and quality as well. I should not have sized up and the quality is just an average H&M/Zara (maybe even worse), the material is thinner than expected. They also promise all costs are covered by them in the EU and there are no hidden costs, however I had to pay customs upon arrival. I contacted the customer service and I received super quick answer from robot Lucy, that it is just a one time occasion (obviously a lie) that the courier company didn't handle the package as DDP, but they will refund me the extra cost. I didn't like that they say if I want to return my order they can only provide the amount of customs in store credits as they send the cost of customs already as part of a refund. However this is all their fault, so I guess this is the way they are making people spending money at their store. Surprisingly I received the amount of customs back btw, but having read all the negative reviews I do not dare to send back my order now. Allover I will just rather not order again from this store as I am disappointed by the quality and customs. Giving 2 stars because the customer service is working quickly and I like the style of the clothes, tho.",

They have stolen my money, and it seems I am not the only one facing this problem. Clothes are nice but it is not worth the hassle and the theft of your money!! Stay clear you can get the same clothes elsewhere & they won‚Äôt steal from you!!!!",

Terrible experience, terrible customer service, do not order from here.\n\nMy review that was taken down below.\n\nI recently purchased a pair of Tailored Bermuda Shorts from Because of Alice, hoping they would be perfect for my holiday. Unfortunately, when I finally tried them on while packing, I discovered faulty stitching along the zip, which created a small hole. The shorts still had the original tags attached and were unworn.\n\nI reached out to their customer service, explaining the situation and requesting a return or refund. To my disappointment, I received a response from Lucy stating that they have a 30-day return/warranty period and that they are unable to assist me since this period had passed (by two weeks) and signed off with ‚Äòhave a lovely day‚Äô without any attempt to address the faulty product I received.\n\nDespite explaining that the fault was clearly a manufacturing issue, Lucy was not helpful and refused to offer any solution or compensation. I find it unacceptable that a company would not stand by the quality of their products beyond such a short period, especially when the defect is clearly not due to wear and tear. Going by other reviews it‚Äôs not the first time Lucy has dealt with a customer issue in this manner.\n\nThis experience has left me very disappointed with both the quality of the product and the lack of support from the customer service team. I would caution others to thoroughly check their purchases immediately upon receipt and be aware of the strict return policy.

Why would I keep a top in a size that doesn‚Äôt fit? I was very careful to check I returned everything due to the price and they refuse to accept the possibility of a human error on their part. I returned several items so it‚Äôs quite likely that the warehouse operative made a mistake.\nAbsolutely disgusted at the lack of responsibility taken for this and now I am out of pocket ¬£65 whilst BOA have probably already resold the top. Once I received the generic email they have ignored all following emails. It‚Äôs a shame as I see lots of nice clothes advertised but I refuse to give them any more of my money and would strongly recommend you avoid this scam at all costs.\nAlso, their return policy is a breach of UK distance selling regulations (re.

I spent nearly $1000 building a capsule BOA wardrobe, but after owning most of these clothes for less than 8 months the quality is absolutely atrocious. I purchase a total of 13 pairs of pants and 7 of them are experiencing the same issue within the first 6 months. The inner lining detaches from the outer causing permanent wrinkling to the point the clothes are unwearable. I now worry my remaining clothes will experience the same fate. When I reached out to BOA, the customer service associate told me that I was beyond the 30 day refund/defect time period and that there was nothing they could do. After this they proceeded to cut off all communication. I am absolutely appalled that the only solution I was offered was to take the over $600 loss on the chin.

The clothes are lovely, the customer service is totally appalling - do not buy from this brand\nUpdate - they have come back to say they only issue refunds if the item has a manufacturers fault, apparently the top falling apart after a few hours wear is my fault.

So it is like that fine footnote in tiny font on contract that is added there to get you. Anyways, the products are too expensive for what they are, and customer support is not supportive at all .

I was anticipating it would be a long and frustrating back-and-forth between me, BOA, and the postal service, and eventually I would be the one who was out $90 and a shirt for my bridal shower. Instead, Lucy kindly and quickly offered to re-send the item free of charge. This was extremely impressive customer service and I am now a BOA loyalist! Thank you again Lucy and BOA!

I then received the parcel which I no longer required and sent it back. I've had nothing to confirm that the parcel has arrived and still awaiting my Refund. I spoke to Lucy and advised that I don't think it's fair that I had to pay for postage to send or return as I had tried to cancel the order. I've been ignored. Luckily they are local to me so if they don't respond with any kind of refund or acknowledgment of my parcel I shall go and pay them a visit: the clothes look lovely but I won't be buying again",

    "review": "NO, just no. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IN THE US, READ THIS REVIEW!\n\nI had been watching this brand evolve for years. Always loved their stuff from the jump, but had seen a few others give bad reviews (mostly on shipping and sizing not being consistent) that made me hesitant to pull the trigger. I should have listened!\n\nI waited until BOA had a mega Black Friday sale and went all in. Spent hours narrowing down selections from different categories, researching and reading corresponding reviews to determine best sizing. When everything was all said and done, I spent almost 2 grand! I justified the money because I would use the clothes for work and got a discount due to the sale. Even though there are a few pieces I like, I regret ever purchasing and do not think the clothes in any way are worth the time, effort and money.\n\nThe First Reg Flag:\nAfter I placed my order, I noticed BOA's instagram started getting blown up with negative comments from other consumers about missing packages and customer support not responding. Some users even started to comment more aggressively, noting that BOA was deleting their comments on top of missing packages and not responding. I got nervous and felt in my gut I should cancel my order right then and there... and I should have!\n\nFirst Complaint- Shipping & Communication:\nI placed my order and when I didn't hear ANYTHING from the company for over a week and the tracking information had not been updated, I decided to reach out. Megan responded a day later and sent new tracking information. Right then and there, the tracking info Megan sent said all three shipments were held and delayed due to a 'Customs Clearance'. I contacted BOA again and notified them the packages were stuck in customs and asked for their help. BOA responded that they were working on it. After a few days of no further advancement, I took matters into my own hands and contacted customs directly, myself. Customs said the packages were held because there was no package slip identifying the contents/items. Customs also said they had tried to reach out to BOA for further information to clear the package, but were unable to get in contact. I then asked how I could help. Customs said for me to send an itemized list of the contents of the package, including full details on the clothing's composition. I spent hours tracking down the contents of each package, copying and pasting information from the website for each item and sending the details to customs. After customs received, processed and had me sign some documents, they released the packages.\n\nSecond Complaint- Quality:\nDespite my extensive research and personal measurements, the clothes did indeed all fit differently. I would say 60% of what I ordered fit appropriately and was accurate to the websites information for sizing. Many of the garments had loose seams with open holes and poor stitching. The same item in two different colors fit differently. Especially frustrating because I did my research, but nevertheless, I went to the website to process a return.\n\nThird Complaint- Processes:\nBOA charges for every return and does not allow items to be returned that are missing the protective crotch sticker. Um... how the heck is someone supposed to try on a bodysuit that buttons at the crotch when there is a sticker there preventing them from unbuttoning? The price for a return makes the return not worth it, in my opinion. I gifted what didn't fit me. Ugh, BOA got their money.\n\nNow for the parts that make me REALLY MAD...\n\nFourth Complaint- The Wear:\nI purchased some extremely overpriced 'alpaca' or 'alpaca blend' sweaters. One wear in and one of the styles was a disgusting pilling mess. A real obvious sign of cheap quality. One wear in and the other was shedding long strains of hair all over me and everything I own. Forget pairing cream or white with black! UGH!!! Any RESPECTABLE company should take the return after wear when the quality is this bad, and let you make the return FOR FREE.\n\nFifth Complaint- Customs Fees!\nThis one is the one that really hurt. After such a negative experience from start to finish, I just got a bill in the mail for OVER $500 IN CUSTOMS FEES! Are you kidding me?! Customs charged extra for the packaging slip being missing and having to key in all the content details. Yes, I'M being charged for that when it was poor handling/preparation from the COMPANY.\n\nThis has been a long review, so to summarize...\nThere are better brands out there, with the same quality, for a lesser price, with better policies and practices. Save yourself a lot of time, disappointment and money and stay away from this one. Kudos to all of the good reviews on here who bought one or two pieces, got them on time and liked them... I have a feeling they just got lucky and if they continue to buy, they will eventually be burned.",

Now I have source a more similar looking bottoms to make it look like a real set.\n\nTheir supply chain or fulfillment operations is really bad, no exchange and no free returns (you need to pay for return shipment). I ordered the top and bottoms separately because they don‚Äôt restock fast (also their stock reminder alert suck and don‚Äôt work - you need to manually check). I believe their orders/ deliveries were in a mess as the bottoms that I ordered a few days after arrived before the top and I had waited extra long like 2 weeks to get the top.

There is a rule in the Netherlands that states that if you return everything from the order the seller is obligated to refund the price for the products and the initial shipping (delivery) costs. Meanwhile the return costs need to be paid by the customer. I know that BOA is a UK based store so i went and looked at the law in the UK said and basically i found out that the EU rules also still apply for the UK. This means that the law states that the seller must pay for the shipping costs if the customer returns everything from the order. Because i returned everything from the order i am hereby entitled to receive a refund for the shipping costs. I have also linked the websites where i found this information and send it to them.\n\nI never received an answer from them (it‚Äôs been a month now) which leads me to think that they don‚Äôt want to get into this.

However, their customer service leaves much to be desired.\nI purchased a leather dress during the final sale, following the size guidelines provided. Despite ordering a size S for a snug fit based on my measurements (which should have comfortably fit within the size M range), the dress turned out to be too big and ill-fitting. This was incredibly frustrating, as the size chart proved to be completely inaccurate‚ÄîI should have opted for an XS according to my measurements, but the chart indicated I was a size M.\nI reached out to customer service, hoping for a simple exchange for a smaller size. Unfortunately, I received a firm \"no\" due to the non-returnable policy on final sale items.\nThis lack of flexibility and understanding is disappointing. Had the size chart been accurate, I wouldn't have encountered this issue. All I requested was the same dress in a smaller size‚Äîa request that wouldn't have impacted the company's bottom line, as they would still sell the final sale item.\nNow, I'm left with an item that doesn't fit and a waisted my money‚Äîa situation that could have easily been rectified with better customer service.\nIt's my hope that BOA reevaluates its customer-centric approach to avoid such experiences in the future and prioritise building value with its customers.",

A few weeks later I get an invoice from FedEx for over $250 for custom fees! I have never ordered from UK before so I didn't realize. When I reached out to BOA, they said that any orders above $800 at full retail price were subject to import tax and linked to a help desk article that I can't find anywhere on their site. This info was not on their shipping page, where I originally checked. I feel incredibly misled.

This is not clearly stated on the sale page of the items but only in the small print of the return section which nobody tends to read prior to purchase as reputable companies usually offer refunds or at least exchanges.\nI emailed in the hope the company would have some goodwill and at least allow me to exchange if not refund, but no, they were quite unhelpful and dismissed me quickly with a fairly blunt reply.

Surely as the provider, this is their customer duty to resolve this issue. I am currently 37 weeks pregnant, have paid for an item that I do not have and still waiting for any update/ refund from either Evri or BOA (after chasing numerous times). It has now been over 10days.",

I couldn‚Äôt find my order number so I emailed them asking if they could find my order with the details i provided and if I could get a refund or do an exchange. Megan, who was the person I was dealing with was AMAZING! I received an email back within 2 hours and within 6 hours the waistcoat that I had originally ordered had been shipped out to me. Honestly the best customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced! I pretty much only shop at BOA as I love their simple and timeless pieces. I will STILL be ordering my full wardrobe from them. Yes I received the wrong order but mistakes happen and how quickly they rectified it was not only amazing but quite impressive!
