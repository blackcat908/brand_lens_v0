I‚Äôm normally a standard size UK/Aus 10/M, bust 12C the halter top fits, if any thing a tiny bit tight especially when sitting. Also too small for me to wear a bra with. I tried a L in the halter but was too big and no way to adjust. The Sleeveless runs small, could not zip up the M. The L fits well with a bra. Both are excellent quality.\n\nI visited the London shop to purchase so no experience with postal/delivery.",

    "review": "Seems great on the surface however, once you try and get a refund, you are at OddMuse mercy.\n\nAs many, I‚Äôve seen OddMuse plastered over my social media‚Äôs and I was after a nice white dress for my home-hen as the bride to be. I checked out OddMuse as they had stacks of lovely tailored white dresses, perfect.\n\nI took my measurements to understand my sizing as I‚Äôm a size 12/14, however, they wanted me to get an XXL just due to my boobs, which, is only a 16. Since when was a L a 12, XL a 14, XXL a 16? Then the sizing stops. Not inclusive plus gives a body check on avg sized girlies.\n\nI bought a size 12 & 14 due to this. Parcel arrived quickly, not very well packaged even after spending ¬£300, a brown envelope with the dresses in SheIn-esque bags. Tried both dresses on, alas size 14 fitted due to my bust but it was so short. So I decided to return them both. This is when it gets fun.\n\nAs the dresses were ¬£165 each, I‚Äôd rather do with my cash back sooner rather than later. I knew there was a 14 days return policy, so thought I‚Äôd process it quickly. Once you request your returns, which you have to pay ¬£5 warehouse fee and the Royal Mail ¬£4.95 postage fee, you are already ¬£10 out of pocket, just to have the pleasure to return to OddMuse.\n\nOh, then you have 48 hours to use your QR code on returns, before your refund is cancelled. This shocked me. A time limit to send your return, so word of advice, make sure you can get to the post office within 48hrs of actioning your return. I think due to this, this is why there are SO many brand new dresses with tags on Vinted, people who unfortunately missed this window.\n\nI sent my return off, then I waited on the refund notification. Please see timeline below on how long it took for refund to actually be processed (all days are standard, not working). OddMuse are quick to take your cash, but are very happy to sit on yours‚Ä¶.\n\nDay 1 - parcel received (next day delivery)\nDay 3 - returns requested\nDay 4 - return sent\nDay 5 - return received by odd muse\nDay 22 - refund notification from OddMuse saying refund will be in my bank within 10 working days\nDay 25 - payment received in bank\n\nOn their T&Cs it states refunds can take 14 working days to process. This is a lie, as above.\n\nOddMuse is a cowboy company and are making cash off poor fitted dresses, knowing they will be returned as their sizing it shot, to make ¬£5 a pop. The fact an online retailer, which has little overheads charges you for their refund handling is outrageous. Happy to pay for P&P but handling is a joke.\n\nI would never buy off OddMuse again and I‚Äôm telling everyone to stay away, unless they are happy without their cash for nearly a month.",

Avoid online shopping unless you are 100% certain it will fit! Pls check Google reviews and their social media, loads of similar feedback sadly and no one seem to care!\nEDIT: if you bought online and paid by credit card contact your bank and report it.

I happened to be going down from North Wales to London the next day on route to the event/getting the Eurostar - and decided I would try taking it into the store to exchange or return. The staff were rude and unhelpful, providing abysmal customer service which left me feeling horrible. I‚Äôve never come across a shop refusing to let you exchange or return their products to them in-store before and they didn‚Äôt need to make me feel stupid for asking. I ended up buying another dress from elsewhere.\n\nFast forward a week and I try to go through the returns process online - and like everybody else giving one star reviews - I encountered the extortionate charges, the lack of communication regarding timelines and generally more pretty appalling customer service.\n\nI am so disappointed in this brand, the quality of the clothing, and the service I experienced.

(The store by the way, is the size of a shoe box, perhaps they actually have no money to spend on rent/ don‚Äôt care much for their customers shopping experience). When I got home and tried it on again, the quality was shockingly bad. It quickly turned into a very ugly, poorly made garment. I then went online to return it via their portal, only to find it marked as ‚Äúineligible for return‚Äù (which was completely untrue-the receipt clearly stated it was returnable).\n\nI emailed them immediately-no reply. And I mean no one got back to me. I was flying overseas the next day and needed the return processed urgently. There‚Äôs no phone number listed anywhere, so there‚Äôs genuinely no way to get through to them. A total waste of ¬£135.\n\nSide note: I‚Äôm convinced they marked it ineligible on purpose, assuming most people wouldn‚Äôt bother driving all the way back to the store to return it. It honestly felt like a tactic to keep the money. The lack of a contact number only supports this-it‚Äôs a deliberate move to make communication impossible.\n\nSo, the next day, I drove 45 minutes back to the store, spent 30 minutes finding parking, and paid another ¬£25-all because the online return wouldn‚Äôt work. When I got to the store, I calmly but firmly explained the situation. Not a single apology or acknowledgment from the staff. No surprise, no sympathy. That was when it really hit me-I was dealing with a company that is dishonest and fake.\n\nWhen I got home and checked my bank app, I saw that the refund was declined because Odd Muse never completed the processing. They did not send me my refunded money.\n\nI emailed again. And again. And again. No response. Not a single word from anyone. Their customer service is nonexistent. I even went on Instagram and saw comment after comment under the founder Aimee Smale‚Äôs posts-and on Odd Muse‚Äôs own posts-saying the exact same thing I experienced. I also commented on Aimee‚Äôs tik tok a few times and instead of replying, apologising and giving me back my money, she BLOCKED me.\n\nBefore shopping there, my friend warned me she‚Äôd heard terrible things about the brand. I should‚Äôve listened. I thought I‚Äôd give them a chance. Big mistake.\n\nThis company does not deserve a single penny of revenue. I am completely appalled by Odd Muse.\n\nIf I could give zero stars, I would.",

I spent MONTHS drooling over these dresses and then when I got engaged I knew it was time! As a teacher who basically lives in jeans and tshirts, I was looking forward to having something that met that tailored look I was going for in my photos. My problem started with sizing. Based on the measurements for my pear shaped body, I went with the 3x. Unfortunately, their size chart was off by several inches so I reached out to customer service via email. I asked them about sizing and they made suggestions which were helpful but then customer service pointed out they make no international exchanges. I‚Äôm a Florida native and I have NEVER received a package so fast that wasn‚Äôt from Amazon. It took two days - so I am confident that they did not ship internationally- even though shipping and fees cost me $50. I pointed this out and I pointed out that I had the Swap protection. This name is easily misleading though - it only takes place if my package is lost. After confirming that I could not exchange but instead return for credit, less my fifty shipping fee, they told me they hoped to earn my trust back one day. I tried asking to speak to someone on the phone but they ignored that piece of my request.

I was further informed on the 12th April, following my detailed response they were happy to accept the refund and that the item was in the process of being returned to me; therefore, I was advised by Odd Muse Support to reject the items from the courier which was done on the 14th April all dates of 2025. I have since emailed over 7 times to receive a response that my refund has been processed. I have since taken to social media to express the urgency of my situation as I have been left 7 weeks without a full entitled refund of the purchase price paid. The actions of Odd Muse are in direct contravention of the Consumer Act 2015 which I have expressed in my last email to both their order email address and press email address in attempts to be given a response and satisfactory solution given the time lapsed without a refund.

    "review": "Absolutely awful service. Chose a dress on back order, purchased 27th april advised at time of ordering would be sent on ON OR BEFORE may 1st, fine I thought wanted it first a last minute function on the 3rd , so I paid next day delivery as then the very latest would be may 2nd. It wasn't sent on time. Ok fine I wore something else, sent the dress straight back (didn't even open it, they'd also sent wrong colour) I queried about shipping, they said there had been a delay, ok but at time of ordering you specified dates hence why I paid extra for next day. No refund on next day delivery. Communication is so poor , I was advised it was received back may 8th, (no email to say this i had to ask) and 10 working days till refund. That's today. I emailed again twice asking about it, no replies. Now I get an emai tonight saying they have the dress and will take 10 working days for refund. That's up to may 6th , 29 days since the received it back to do a refund. Without my emails i dont think it would have been processed. Over a month since purchase. Customer service is poor, don't know why I paid the extra ¬£6 protect option either, thinking it would aid the process should the dress need returning. Will never, ever order from you again, over hyped, growing too fast to keep up with basic customer service. Send me my refund!!!!!",

The add on of the extra charges for the swap protection and admin restock fee are also unlawful and excessive.\n\nUnder UK law you have a right to change your mind and let the retailer know up to 14 days from when you receive it and then you have a further 14 days to physically return the item. They CANNOT refuse to refund you if you requested a return within 14 days from date of delivery and then got the item returned within 28 days from date of delivery!!\n\nA very unethical brand with extortionate prices, terrible fitting items and an unlawful returns policy.",

However in my rush I sent my OM return to the other brand and the other brand to OMs return address. The other brand actually didn‚Äôt notice but OM emailed me, posted my parcels back to me (I paid postage for my mistake), kindly extended my refund window and allowed me to contact the other brand recall that package and resend them both to the right places. Received my refund within a day or two of them receiving the correct return, whereas I had to chase the other brand almost 11 days after they received it even though it was still within their normal returns window.\nI‚Äôve seen discourse online about Odd Muse‚Äôs fabric choices which can be fair but I‚Äôve never felt so good in a dress as the one I chose for this event. As someone struggling with my body rn I felt so confident and safe in my dress and I know I‚Äôll get so much more use out of it, two friends have already asked to borrow her.

Yet they‚Äôre refusing to refund me and are sending the dress back.\n\nSo now I‚Äôm stuck with three dresses, none of which fit me, and no help from their team. Completely unacceptable.\n\nI do not recommend buying from OddMuse. Unfriendly customer service, rigid policies, sizing issues, and a dismissive attitude. Disappointed beyond words.",

First of all, they automatically toggle something called a 'package protection fee' which is basically unnecessary and costs ¬£9. It is really sneaky the way this is done, I didn't notice until afterwards and they refuse to refund you for it. They also charged me ¬£4.95 for delivery (you only get free shipping over ¬£200, which seems incredibly high).\nI needed to return one of the dresses I ordered, which meant a further ¬£4.95 in return shipping costs and a ¬£5 ‚Äòhandling fee‚Äô. As a business that operates predominantly online, I was genuinely shocked to see such steep costs for basic online ordering and return services. In total, this meant I had paid ¬£23 for basic admin, to have nothing to show for it in return. At some other online stores, ¬£23 would have bought you an entire dress. I emailed the Odd Muse customer service to express my unhappiness at the costs, and was told there was absolutely nothing they could do, not even in way of a goodwill gesture. They tell you that it‚Äôs in the small print in the website, but their relationship with their customers is surely more important than the small print- and it‚Äôs something they are not prioritising. I will never shop with them again, and having seen other online websites now offering copycat versions of Odd Muse dresses, I would recommend trying those instead.",

When I tried to resolve the issue, customer service was unhelpful and it was very difficult to get a timely response through both email and live chat. For a brand that claims to empower women and prioritize customer satisfaction, the lack of transparency and accountability was incredibly frustrating. I will be disputing the charge with my credit card provider and taking my business elsewhere.",

Knowing how I felt, I choose not to try on the size extra small, nor did I take this dress out of the packaging.\n\nBoth dresses were returned to Odd Muse within 14 days as per the returns policy stated on their website. Both dresses were returned in their original condition, unworn, unwashed and with all original tags and packaging intact as per their returns policy outlined on their website.\n\nSoon after, I received an email stating the dress in size extra small (the dress which I did not take out of the packaging), contained an odour and therefore does not meet their above returns policy and cannot be refunded. The other dress (which I did try on) size small however, was eligible for returns and therefore refunded.\n\nHearing their decision was final and the dress was already in the post back to my address, I was absolutely appalled I was not given the opportunity to contest this! Now, explain this, if the dress was not tried on and was not taken out of the original packaging, the item must have been sold to me in an unsatisfactory condition. This is not how I expected to be treated. I was so excited to place my first order with this brand and now it has completely changed my opinion of ordering online in general! I have never been treated so badly by a company!\n\nMultiple emails have been sent back and forth but the attitude I have received from Odd Muse is that this is my fault and there is nothing they can do! I am absolutely disgusted by the customer service I have received, and I cannot believe that they are not willing to refund a ¬£135 dress that I did not try on!\n\nI have reported Odd Muse to trading standards and I hope that by reading this review, customers will think twice about ordering through this poorly run clothing brand! There is nothing luxury about the service I have received!\n\nHaving purchased these items through Klarna, I have been lucky to receive their support and three months later, I have finally got my money back. However, please think twice before purchasing as it is just not worth the stress you will go through trying to get your money back!!",

    "review": "I had seen a lot online about these dresses and I have to say that they were not too different from what you may find at Boohoo. I liked the fit, but the fabric was not luxurious. I ordered 3 dresses and decided to send them all back and that‚Äôs when the issues started. It was sent back straight away and I got the confirmation of receipt on the 7th April and the email says a few days but then I had to email on the 17th to chase up as I did not know if they were accepted or refused. They say it‚Äôs 10 business days but not stated in the email. I finally got it through today saying I have been partially refunded. The returns policy says ¬£5 handling fee and you pay for delivery. Apparently the return of 3 items costs me ¬£30! Careful, there‚Äôs an opt-in or out charge- claims to be a fast service and ¬£3, somehow it‚Äôs ¬£15. Very sneaky if you ask me. All in all, it will take up to 3 weeks from the return for the money to reach my account. Other sites you do not have to pay for returns or you pay for just the returns. Completely puts me off, it‚Äôs a hassle, and to be a company who is trying to make a name for themselves, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to charge extortionate amounts to return items. It‚Äôs hard to keep loyalty and anyone who asks I will say, the clothes are a little overpriced and they charge a lot to return. You should really look at your policy and how you can cut the cost, hardly screams luxurious. I‚Äôve had a back and forth in emails, and they don‚Äôt really care. It‚Äôs just a this is it, we make enough so whatever. I‚Äôve asked for a full breakdown of the return price I paid and haven‚Äôt had one, I don‚Äôt get their calculations and they won‚Äôt tell me.\n\nNow they‚Äôre saying I paid ¬£15 for the swap protect (opt in) when I bought the items, but I‚Äôve also paid ¬£15 in my return for it, so overall ¬£30. Doesn‚Äôt mention that in their return policy! Awful.",

I don't understand why they call themselves 'Luxury' - surely luxury would be using luxurious, natural fabrics?\nI like that they use a diverse range of models, in terms of sizes and skin colour, which makes a refreshing change from other brands.\nThe return process is not great. You pay for the delivery, and then pay a ¬£10 handling fee (why?!? no other brands do this, and you are hardly small?) - my parcel arrived with them on 11th April and I received no confirmation, but had to chase them to confirm receipt of my return.\nI won't be buying from them again - way too pricey for what you get, and the returns process seems created to trip people up.",

On 25/03/2025, I noticed the refund hadn't been processed to my debit card and contacted customer service. They informed me that the refund had gone to a gift card because part of the purchase was made with one.\n\nI clarified on 01/04/2025 that only ¬£92 of the total order was paid with a gift card and that the remainder was paid via debit card. However, I was told that nothing could be done since the refund had already been processed.\n\nI‚Äôve now repeatedly requested that the refund be corrected to my debit card, but my request has been ignored. I am only asking for a refund to my debit card for the ¬£153 I paid via debit card ‚Äì not an additional refund beyond the ¬£92 from the gift card.\n\nThis is a simple mistake that could have been easily corrected, but customer service has failed to address the issue properly. I am incredibly frustrated by the lack of urgency in resolving this and would appreciate it if someone more senior could review my case and rectify this situation.\n\nI would not recommend shopping here based on my experience.

Returned a garment that was denied return for small marks on the neckline (emphasis on small, I had to zoom in), which occurred from the natural wear of a garment when trying something on (something everyone does when buying clothes in-store & online). They have not even allowed me to have the garment back after my return (I spent ¬£55 on it) so I have lost money just through purchasing through them. To add, the garments are poor quality for their price point. Shop elsewhere.",

    "review": "As a loyal customer of Odd Muse for the past three years, I am incredibly disappointed with how they are currently treating me. I recently purchased the black tracksuit and was so excited to receive it. Upon arrival, I was genuinely happy with the quality. Having built quite the collection over the years, I know exactly how to care for my Odd Muse pieces.\n\nI washed my tracksuit on a 20-degree hand wash, following the same care routine I always do. To my surprise, the trousers shrank. Concerned, I emailed Odd Muse on March 19th and received a response stating that there was nothing they could do. I found this response quite unsatisfactory, as I believe this is clearly a fault with the product. I kindly requested to be directed to a manager to discuss the matter further.\n\nSince then, I have sent three follow-up emails and, nine days later, I have yet to receive a response. This level of customer service is unacceptable. When I spend ¬£200 on a tracksuit, I expect both the product and the service to reflect the luxury image they project. Unfortunately, while their clothes may exude luxury, their customer service does not.\n\nMy opinion of Odd Muse has changed, and I sincerely hope they address this issue and improve their customer service for loyal customers like myself in the future.",

    "review": "I really wanted to love Odd Muse as I admired the owner's story, however the brand is really not what it's trying to be and the quality and service is pretty terrible.\n\nIt markets itself as luxury womenswear and is priced as such, however the fabric is far from luxury and the sizing is inconsistent. The returns process is TERRIBLE - they charge for returns (which is a reach given how inconsistent the sizing is), and you have 14 days to return. However, what they don't tell you is that once you've generated your return, you only have 2 days to post, and the only carrier option is Royal Mail (the least convenient of all.) If you don't post within 2 days, despite there being a 14 day return window, your return is cancelled. To add insult to injury, despite giving you such a chronically short window to post, once they finally receive your return it takes FOURTEEN days for them to credit your account. This is not the level of service that's expected of luxury brands with the Odd Muse price point.\n\nI actually wrote to Odd Muse to share my feedback before posting this review, and the response I received just showed how much they have to learn as a brand.\n\nEdit: The response I've received on here just highlights what I'm saying. Having to return within 14 days was never the issue but I seem to be receiving this same copy and paste / chat bot response every time.",

I received my item on February 4th, notified you of my intent to return it on February 12th, and returned it on February 20th‚Äîwell within the legal time frame.\n\nHowever, it seems your return policy is not fully in compliance with these regulations, as it does not accommodate the necessary time periods or the process for an exchange, which is my specific request. This puts me in a position where I feel my statutory rights are not being honored.\n\nAdditionally, I made my purchase with a credit card, which provides me extra protection under Section 75. While I understand your company‚Äôs return policies are usually stringent, it is important to recognize that these laws exist to ensure fairness for consumers, and it seems your policy may be overlooking these crucial protections.\n\nI hope this review prompts a reassessment of your online return policies so they align with legal standards and offer customers the protection they are entitled to.

    "review": "I am incredibly disappointed with my experience at Odd Muse and feel compelled to warn others before making a purchase. I bought a skirt in-store while visiting London, expecting high quality for the price. However, after just one wear, multiple crystals started falling off, making the skirt unwearable.\n\nWhen I reached out to customer service, instead of taking responsibility, they first offered me only ¬£20 to ‚Äúcover repairs,‚Äù which was completely inadequate. Then, shockingly, they suggested that I should find similar crystals myself and take the skirt to a tailor! That is not an acceptable solution, especially for a high-end brand that claims to sell luxury-quality pieces.\n\nAfter pushing back, they finally agreed to replace the skirt but refused to send a new one immediately, even after I provided clear photographic evidence of the defect. Instead, they forced me to return the faulty item first and wait over 10 working days before even considering sending a replacement. Why should I, the customer, suffer a long wait for a problem that was caused by their poor craftsmanship?\n\nTo make matters worse, after I raised a formal complaint, I was completely ignored. No response, no attempt to resolve the issue, nothing. This shows a complete disregard for customers and a lack of professionalism.\n\nThis entire process has been stressful, frustrating, and unacceptable. A premium brand should stand by its products and prioritize customer satisfaction‚Äînot dismiss valid concerns, ignore complaints, and drag out the resolution process. I have never encountered such poor aftercare service.\n\nI strongly advise anyone considering Odd Muse to think twice before purchasing. If you experience any quality issues (which, based on my experience, is highly possible), be prepared for slow responses, dismissive support, and a long wait for any resolution. And if you raise a complaint, expect to be ignored completely.",

    "review": "I had high hopes for Odd Muse, especially after being inspired by the owner‚Äôs narrative of empowering women in business. Her approach felt personal and relatable, making me eager to support a brand that seemed to genuinely care about its customers. Unfortunately, my experience with the company has completely shattered that image.\n\nI returned ¬£400 worth of dresses because the sizing was so off, expecting a straightforward refund, but instead, I was given store credit, which is not only frustrating but illegal. Customer service responses were nothing more than generic replies that got me nowhere. It's clear that once Odd Muse has your money, they don‚Äôt care about providing any real support or resolving issues. Three weeks went by, and my return was still unresolved, so I had no choice but to initiate a chargeback with my bank, which I successfully won.\n\nWhat really upset me is the lack of transparency and integrity throughout the entire process. This isn't luxury fashion. The materials felt cheap, sizing is off and despite what the brand tries to project, it feels more like a marketing ploy than a genuine commitment to quality or customer service. The ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù persona the owner presents online is nothing more than a facade. When it comes to handling returns and customer issues, it‚Äôs clear that this brand‚Äôs values come from the top down, with the owner‚Äôs justification for their illegal policies being downright insulting. The ¬£5 handling fee and their returns policy feels completely nonsensical and dismissive.\n\nIn the recent videos the owner made on PLT‚Äôs rebranding, I saw a different side of her. How can she have the cheek to call out PLT while herself not even running a legal returns policy? At least, with PLT, I can get my refund quickly without any problem. The hypocrisy here is unbelievable. On top of that, attacking the owner and his family personally in any criticisms just isn‚Äôt cool, no matter how much you dislike the brand.\n\nIt‚Äôs also disheartening to see the brand focus more on luxury marketing, including spending exorbitant amounts to impress celebrities on shows like Selling Sunset, rather than addressing the real concerns of their customers. If you want to shop with a reputable retailer where you‚Äôll actually receive customer care and refunds when needed, go to stores like Harvey Nichols who stocks OM, where your hard-earned money will be respected.\n\nIn summary, Odd Muse‚Äôs behavior and policies have made me question the authenticity of their brand. I feel duped and regret supporting them. If you‚Äôre considering buying from them, I highly suggest thinking twice and shopping elsewhere.",

While I understand the processing and shipping fees, the timely handling of returns is crucial. Their policy states that returns will be processed within seven working days of receipt, but this is not adhered to.\n\nWhat is the point of having policies that you don‚Äôt adhere to? The purpose of having policies is to ensure compliance, and the company‚Äôs failure to do so is concerning.\n\nI even repurchased the correct size from their London store, where the staff provided excellent assistance. However, despite their efforts, I was informed that an exchange could have been made at the store, while the website contradicts this information.\n\nFurthermore, the item I kept developed a hole in the seam after only one wear due to the placement of a label directly through the seam. This issue highlights the disparity between the company‚Äôs online presence and the actual quality of its products and services.\n\nA real shame and I remain out of pocket.\n\nI strongly advise the company to address these concerns promptly.

Took 3 weeks to get here, dispite paying ¬£10 it was sent tracked un signed 48 and left on a door step. The packagaing was a brown paper bag, the box is so cheap. The package doesnt even come with anything personalised or cute as an expensive new start up brand,nothing that shows this is run buy an small business. Honestly shocking packaging.Would be embarrased to gift, but the fact The earings are something from H&M for ¬£7... tarnished, gold coming off, feel like plastic.

I purchased this as a dress for inspiration to get into for the event.\n\nI didn‚Äôt try it on until this past Friday before I headed off, took it out of the odd muse zip lock bag and upon unzipping the pearl to the left of the zip fell straight off, definitely not the quality I was expecting after paying what I did for the dress. If I had worn the dress the whole bottom row would have come lose and fallen off (photo attached).\n\nI‚Äôm so disappointed as my hen do plans were altered entirely as we then had to factor in a shopping trip to find a dress, adding unneeded stress and expense having already spent on the dress I had on my vision board for months. definitely didn't expect this quality after trying it once and it being in the bag since purchase.",

Instead of refunding my money, they forced me into store credit for a significant portion of my return, despite my clear request for a refund to my original payment method.\n\nI understand handling fees, and I accept those, but Odd Muse is outright refusing to return my hard-earned money and is keeping ¬£155 hostage in store credit that I cannot use. I followed all their return conditions, sent everything back in perfect condition, yet they still refuse to issue a full refund.\n\nTheir customer service is dismissive and unhelpful, showing zero understanding or flexibility‚Äîeven when it‚Äôs clear I have no further use for their products. Their return policy is misleading, and once they have your money, they make it incredibly difficult to get it back.\n\nAvoid this brand at all costs if you expect fair treatment, transparency, or decent customer service. I will never shop here again, and I strongly warn others to think twice before purchasing unless you're 100% sure you‚Äôll keep what you buy‚Äîbecause getting your money back will be a nightmare.",

While the clothes initially looked cute, the company's service and policies were absolutely terrible.\n\nFirst, I received a coupon, but it wasn‚Äôt fully honored at checkout. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, it was never fixed. To make matters worse, I paid $415 for a polyester outfit, only to find out I would have to pay an additional $60 for an exchange and $40 for a return ‚Äî both of which felt completely unreasonable. When I asked if I could return the items in store, they refused and insisted I would have to pay the additional $60 for an exchange, no matter what. I regret purchasing from them, especially considering the cheap fabric used in all their clothes.\n\nI emailed customer service several times, but the responses were rude, vague, and unhelpful. They never addressed my concerns properly and seemed to care little about resolving the issues. Eventually, I decided to keep the outfit because their return policy is absurd, but when I finally wore it, the diamonds started falling off the same day.\n\nThis entire experience has been a nightmare. I will never order from Oddmuse again. Their customer service, return policy, and overall handling of my order were awful. I will be sharing my experience on TikTok and Instagram to warn others about this horrible service. Do yourself a favor and shop elsewhere!",

    "review": "I rarely leave reviews, but my experience with Odd Muse has left me no choice. I purchased a white knit jumper expecting a luxury investment piece, yet within just a few months, it has become heavy, stretched, and lost its structure, while the green jumper (same material) bought at the same time remains in perfect condition. For a brand that positions itself as offering ‚Äúinvestment fashion,‚Äù this is unacceptable.\n\nRather than acknowledging a clear quality issue, Odd Muse has only offered a ¬£15 partial refund ‚Äúto assist with the expenses associated with fixing the issue‚Äù‚Äîbut how exactly am I supposed to fix a stretched and misshapen knit? Instead of taking responsibility for a product that should not be failing beyond the return window, they have simply shifted the problem onto me, which is highly disappointing. If this is truly an investment piece, then its quality should be maintained beyond the return window, and any issues arising later should be properly addressed.\n\nOdd Muse explicitly states on their website that they are ‚Äúthe antidote to fast fashion,‚Äù yet dismissing quality concerns just three months after purchase makes me feel this may not be the case which is really sad. I had really wanted to invest in their pieces, believing they would become staples in my wardrobe, but this experience has made me seriously question the longevity and reliability of their products. It‚Äôs a shame because I genuinely loved the green jumper and was excited to purchase more, but now I just feel completely let down.",

The store is so iconic due to the extraordinary style. Even the short waiting in line made the experience more exciting. 'Odd Muse' is so exclusive and chic, I really loved it. The Company are doing the right thing with employing staff who are exceptionally nice. Also love the individual Poly packaging for each garment, nice touch also that you have a picture of each garment on your order and receipt so you know exactly what you have ordered. This was my second visit and I love each garment I bought. The beaded dress I bought in Dec. 2023 got me 'noticed' that I was in an 'Odd Muse' outfit! It is becoming so popular in Ireland where I live. It was a romantic experience from my husband as he spotted the dress on line and I loved it, we then went to London to get it. This year was much the same. I would highly recommend 'Odd Muse'.",

    "review": "I ordered three dresses from Odd Muse. After trying them on at home, I decided to return them all. After returning the dresses, I received an email explaining that one of the returned dresses had been 'rejected' due to it being in 'unsellable' condition. I was outraged, the photos attached were poor quality and you could not even tell if the photo was of the garment I returned. I immediately asked for the clearer photos and an explanation. I waited over a week and received no response but a notification that the dress was being returned to me via the Post Office and I would have the pay the ¬£165 for the dress. This was shocking, no response and just a delivery notification. Upon receiving the dress, I inspected it and found not a single thing wrong with it, i.e. in completely sellable condition. I sent clear photos back to OddMuse and even offered to have a video phone call so that they could review the condition. I waited further for a response and finally received one. They just stated that the return was being rejected. There was no reference to the photographs that I had sent them and no apologies for the time taken to respond to me.\n\nI have spent hours going back and forth, I have tried to be reasonable and send photos of the dress or have a video call. I have received horrendous customer service. I call to question OddMuse's sustainability practices as they have needlessly sent an item back and forth that could have stayed at their warehouse to be re-sold to a customer who actually wanted it.\n\nI would never purchase from this brand again and I warn others to be wary of ordering multiple items to try them on at home as OddMuse's returns rejections process is completely flawed.\n\nI have raised a dispute with the payment processor, Klarna, and hope to get this sorted asap.",

I ordered it in November and the wedding was in early January, I wanted to get it early to make sure it fit and didnt want to gamble on delayed shipping times due to the holiday season. I absolutely loved the dress, its a beautiful fit and the perfect length for my 5'10\" self. Sadly, about two hours into the wedding, the fabric on the dress started to pull when dancing and moving around. I hugged one of the bridesmaids and their dress caught on the fabric and created damage to the dress. For a company that says that they pride themselves on the quality and longevity of their products, this was very disappointing. I got home and sent the team pictures and emails asking if they could give me a different dress because I loved it so much but couldn't wear it again because of the damage. The team said that they were very sorry but I was out of the 14 day return window and the best they could offer me was $20 off. Keep in mind the dress was $235 + international shipping and conversation rates. I emailed back saying how disappointing this was and how frustrated I am because I loved the dress. They stated that they escalated the issue and they would be in touch soon. The next email I got was asking about my experience. I emailed again asking for an update to no avail, which is why I am writing this review. If you can afford to buy a $300+ dress to be worn one time and never again, this is the dress for you.",

I am gobsmacked how a company can constantly talk about how they pride themselves on quality and they make pieces to last years- this is totally incorrect. I have a dress that is completely wasted. The likes of Zara, mango, H&M with prices 5 x less than this brand look after their customers better. I cannot understand how they are not taking responsibility for this when they charge the amount they do. I was firstly told it happened because I put it in the washing machine when I haven‚Äôt even done this! When you spent this much on a dress, I truly think you should be looked after as a customer. I will never ever purchase from this company again. I was going to buy my bridesmaid dresses from here but absolutely not now. You are not protected as a customer in the slightest. For this to have happened to my dress, and for it not be a manufacturing issue, I would have had to sit and purposefully pick the stitching out of my dress- please make this make sense!",

    "review": "I purchased a white dress from Odd Muse in July 2024 and wore it once before taking it to a professional dry cleaner, following the \"dry clean only\" care instructions. Unfortunately, after cleaning, the dress turned grey. The dry cleaner confirmed they followed the correct process and stated that the issue appears to be a fault with the dress itself.\n\nI contacted Odd Muse on January 11th and initially received a response requesting a letter from the dry cleaner, which I provided. However, since then, I have followed up multiple times (January 14th, 18th, 22nd, and 24th) and have had zero response.\n\nIt is incredibly disappointing to spend money on what is supposed to be a high-quality dress, only for it to become unwearable after one use‚Äîand even worse, for customer service to completely ignore my emails.\n\nI had high expectations for this brand, but this experience has been unacceptable. If you're considering purchasing from Odd Muse, be aware that if something goes wrong, you might not get any help at all.",

Upon choosing the size I returned the other dress to which they refused to give me a refund to my card only to my gift voucher. Ridiculous terms and conditions.\nThe dress I did keep is awful quality. Yes it‚Äôs thick material but the boning in the dress is not sewn properly and digs in when wearing.\nAwful customer service as they take a week to get back to your email and there is no number to ring. They have also only even replied to my email when I‚Äôve commented on one of their Instagram posts.\nTo recieve the gift card in the first place it was due to ordering a sale outfit. When I returned this they told me that I hadn‚Äôt included the items and were not willing to refund me (until again outing them on insta) as the items were missing but they were unable to provide proof of how the package arrived or weigh the parcel to see if it would match up to the post office receipt. Took about 3 weeks to get sorted as well due to the slow customer service.\nNot to mention, you have to pay for your items to be protected during shipping?? How odd. I‚Äôve never seen a luxury or budget company do this. Surely if you‚Äôre spending ¬£200 online on one item if your dress didn‚Äôt arrive that would automatically qualify you for a new dress sent out especially since there is only one tiny store in the UK.\nIt‚Äôs not worth the money and the risk of not getting a refund or getting your items at all.",

I am not sure how I‚Äôm supposed to have proof given both items were returned in the one parcel so I responded by saying surely their stock take would prove the skirt was returned.\nI was getting no where with them with the skirt and then received an order confirmation email of a size S top on its way.\nI contacted them again stating the top was no use without the skirt and asked they send me a skirt in S or issue me a refund. I have received no response to my last three emails so basically they have my money and the skirt I ordered.\nIgnoring the problem isn‚Äôt going to make it go away. People work hard for their money and nobody has the right to take it without giving a product in return.

Very short returns window and terrible customer service.\n\nI did an exchange for a different size and on finally arriving I was away on holiday. I contacted them on the day I returned to be told because it was 3 days outside of the 14 day window they would not process my return for a refund, or even credit.\n\nWhat adds to insult as they‚Äôve been marketing the dress as back in stock on Instagram all day, as it‚Äôs part of their main core range but rather than except my return even for credit they‚Äôd rather I‚Äôm stuck with a dress that doesn‚Äôt fit and never buy from them again.\n\nEveryone I‚Äôve told can‚Äôt believe their attitude towards paying customers. It may be a popular brand for influencers , who leave glowing reviews but they won‚Äôt be left with any paying customer long term, certainly none that return.",

Customer service is dreadful and they will do anything to avoid you returning an item.\n\nOrdered a dress and the sizing was way off. Wanted to return but as they charge you a return cost i thought i'd try the larger size. Arrived 4 weeks after I'd returned the original dress while i was on holiday. It was way to big in all the wrong places. Tried to turn but as i was 72 hours over the 14 day return policy they refused. i explained i'd take store credit, again which they refused. At ¬£125+ a dress the attitude towards customers is disgusting.\n\nThey have ignored my response but they still have time to post 100 times on social media. Their customer service team is shocking and they do not care about their customers at all. Avoid. Support a brand that cares about their customers.",

I fear in a bid to run the timer down. In the reply to my emails and chasers, I simply got a reply which did not acknowledge the right to cancel under the distance selling regulations I quoted and my several emails.\nMy request for a returns address so I am able to return the item within 14 days of notifying them of my intent to cancel was not given to me in there eventual reply. I feel this again is overt obstruction to me being able to cancel my order.\n\nFurthermore the item was not the quality represented by the brand nor expected at the price tag they are charging with the pearl square neckline being sown crooked. Even when suggesting this issue lasted on in my chaser emails, they ignored this matter in their eventual reply.\n\nThis experience has left a complete distaste in my mouth and I appalled by the lack of knowledge of consumer rights.

I now have about 6 dresses, 2 tops and counting. I'm obsessed. My only concern is that I am loosing weight and worried my collection may not fit so well next year. I'll just have to stock up again if that's the case.\n\nI have noticed that a few items, assuming from older collections they are phasing out, have a bit of a size discrepancy. However, I was able to return these items. Return shipping isn't cheap, understandably since it's going back overseas, but there is an option to get a slight discount on your next purchase via store credit which makes it worthwhile to me.",

On the other hand, I went on a Sunday near Christmas so that may not have been a fair shot..\nshipping prices to Europe make it really hard to push the button online.",

    "review": "I had purchased three different outfits from Odd Muse in late November 2024; the Ultimate Muse Strapless Dress (Black), the Ultimate Muse Dropped Hem Midi (Lemon), and a skirt and top combo (the Ultimate Muse Midi and the Ultimate Muse Halter Top - both in black). The quality of each piece that I ordered was unreal and unmatched and the fit was generally amazing, so much so that I am on the verge of ordering more shortly! The fit of the Dropped Hem Midi was slightly off in the bust area, but nothing that a little fashion tape could not fix. If you're wondering if you should or shouldn't order from Odd Muse, my recommendation is...DON'T HESITATE, ORDER NOW :) You won't be disappointed. Also side note for Aimee...would love a pop-up store in Melbourne, Australia!! :))))",

The aura, vibes, atmosphere, environment, customer service, and friendliness was exceptional. The clothes are very good quality. Although some will argue that polyester is harmful, honestly almost everything is made out of it. The pieces feel luxurious and soft on the skin. I tried on and purchased the cap sleeve mini dress in black size L and it fit like a glove. However, I also purchased the white split sleeve mini dress in white size L but unfortunately the arms were extremely tight (I felt like I was loosing circulation) so I had to get it tailored and it is now a regular short sleeve rather than a split sleeve. It is a bummer but I‚Äôm still quite happy with my purchases, I understand these things happen and a garment will not fit absolutely everyone equally well. Thank you, Odd Muse. Thank you, Aimee for the wonderful experience.",

I went with the halter midi dress in navy, which arrived very quickly. Upon first try on, it ended up being true to size and I truly have never been more impressed with a dress. You can tell a woman designed it - their team thought of everything. It's comfortable but form-fitting in the right places, so there's no need for Spanx, the cut is feminine whilst still feeling appropriate for all sorts of more formal settings, and the slit in the back makes it easy to walk. This was worth the investment and I will most definitely be purchasing more capstone pieces from them in the future.",

Which was fine because the sales assistant was very kind and apologetic about it, even though she didn‚Äôt need to be. This made the experience already very nice even if we weren‚Äôt in the store yet. I have been looking at the mini skirt for a while and also at the halter neck dress and chocolate, but I didn‚Äôt want to order online since the clothes are tailor-made and I have a bigger chest and wasn‚Äôt sure about my sizing. I wear a large in the dresses with a 34F cup and an extra large on the bottoms since I have also a larger bigger bum. The dresses and the skirts are not too short. They fit perfectly, and the quality is immaculate. You can see that a lot of thought goes into the process of designing And production of the garments. However, this review doesn‚Äôt have a five star rating because there are only two dressing rooms and it‚Äôs a very small store for such a skyrocketing successful brand. It‚Äôs a 9.5 out of 10 due to only two changing rooms. Nonetheless, I would definitely let recommend odd muse!",

The color is stunning ‚Äì such a fresh, soft shade that‚Äôs perfect for any occasion. The fabric feels amazing, and the fit is super flattering without being too much.\n\nWhat I love most is how versatile it is. I‚Äôve dressed it up with heels for a night out, but it also works perfectly with some chunky sandals for a more casual vibe. It‚Äôs the kind of dress that makes you feel instantly put together with minimal effort ‚Äì we all need more of that in our wardrobe!\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for chic, effortless pieces that stand out without trying too hard, I can‚Äôt recommend Odd Muse enough. The quality and style are next level, and I‚Äôm already eyeing my next purchase!",

I can't wait to wear it for my rehearsal dinner!\n\nWhat did you like about the item:\nI loved the timeless, chic design and how flattering the silhouette is overall. The satin material catches the light beautifully and adds a touch of glamour. The mini length strikes the perfect balance between playful and sophisticated.\n\nWas the fit true to size:\nWhile the dress fit well in most areas, it was noticeably tight in the bust for me as a 34DD who typically wears a Medium. I‚Äôd recommend sizing up if you have a larger bust to avoid feeling restricted. Otherwise, the Medium fit as expected in the waist and hips.\n\nHow was your shipping and delivery experience:\nShipping was seamless! The dress arrived earlier than expected and was packaged beautifully. Odd Muse clearly puts care into their customer experience.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI‚Äôd definitely recommend this dress for its quality and design, but if you‚Äôre fuller in the chest, consider sizing up for a more comfortable fit.",

That‚Äôs not the case here‚Äîeverything I‚Äôve ordered has looked just as good in real life as it does in the photos.

The shop assistants were SO friendly and lovely and incredibly helpful. I loved the touches of having heels in the dressing room. I purchased one of the dresses (white pearl mini) and the fit is INCREDIBLE. I got an XXS and I‚Äôm a size 4/6 for reference. The pearl detailing and the tailoring was perfect and I got so many compliments. I cannot wait to extend my Odd Muse collection with the bridal dresses!
