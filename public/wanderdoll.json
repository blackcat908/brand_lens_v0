    "review": "Ordered the Yris dress in white. It came and was see-through, as well as having a very odd extra bit of material on the shoulder which looked like a badly manufactured hiccup. I then received a gift card from them when I returned it, despite choosing ‚Äúrefund back to original payment method‚Äù when creating the return. I contacted them, and was told that ‚ÄúFC‚Äù on the product name meant final call which means no refund given, only gift card. They expect their customers to know that the abbreviation meant that. I asked them to show in my account original order email confirmation, where it says that it was final call, and they weren‚Äôt able to show this to me, just keep highlighting the ‚ÄúFC‚Äù on their website. I‚Äôm not sure why I ordered from them, as I‚Äôve ordered a total of 3 times now and have always had to return due to poor manufacturing or material. It is convenient that a dress which shows your full seamless underwear, is under ‚ÄúFC‚Äù meaning customers will never be reimbursed. Their customer service advisor was also very patronising and rude in his last email; he could not show me the terms and conditions in my screenshot I sent of my original email, but kept advising me I ‚Äúclearly‚Äù agreed to this by checking out.",

    "review": "I bought the ARIA Maxi Dress in a size 12. It went on easily but was impossible to take off without help. The poor construction means the dress can‚Äôt be removed without placing it under stress. I wasn‚Äôt wearing makeup, tan, or body products, and filmed the struggle to remove it.\n\nWander Doll refused my return, citing ‚Äúmarks‚Äù on the satin ‚Äî but the photos they provided show normal creases and folds, not product transfer or damage. Satin is known to mark easily under pressure, and the fabric used offers no tolerance for standard trying-on.\n\nThe size 12 is also labelled ‚Äúlarge‚Äù but fits more like a 10. I‚Äôm a true 12 and rarely have sizing issues.\n\nTrying something on to assess fit is a legal right. If a dress becomes unsellable from being tried on once, it‚Äôs not fit for purpose. I‚Äôve escalated this with Klarna and Trading Standards and would advise others to be cautious before buying.",

My original dress arrived with some minor marks on it, so I emailed customer services and Gary was there to assist. He immediately offered me a replacement, I just had to return my item and show the proof of postage and a new one was shipped to me with next day delivery (the wedding was in a matter of days so I made some requests i.e. not having to wait for them to receive the dress before shipping my replacement, and for it to be sent next day), and Gary was super helpful in making this possible! He also personally checked my replacement item before shipping, to check it was perfect! Thanks a lot Gary, and Wanderdoll for the gorgeous dress!",

They just simply say, I ironed it and that's why it happened, nothing to do about it. WOW. Honestly, I think it's a 16 year old child, trying to sell dresses. DO NOT BUY HERE! Never, ever, will I buy again on such a shitty website.\n\nAs below you can see, they blame the customer. I received it, opened it and saw the stain. Imagine being this customer and they blame you.

When I received the dress, it did not have the tags or ribbons attached, which I assumed was an oversight during the packing process. The dress was also too big for me, so I never wore it.\n\nHowever, when I tried to return it, I was informed that they couldn't accept the return because the item was missing its tags and ribbons. This is extremely frustrating, especially because those items were never included with the dress in the first place. It's clear to me that they are using the return policy as a way to avoid issuing refunds.\n\nI find this to be a dishonest practice and feel cheated by the company's refusal to process a return, despite the fact that the dress was in unworn condition. The dress was an expensive purchase, and the company is clearly using unfair tactics to keep money while providing no resolution for the customer.\n\nI would not recommend this company to anyone.

Been told I must not have done so, which has really upset me as the company have insinuated I‚Äôve lied without even properly inspecting or testing the product. I always follow correct instructions and never had any problems.\nIt‚Äôs rude and not treating customers fairly. So frustrating when you follow the instructions on the label. Liaised with trading standards who have advised at the bare minimum they should have offered to test the item with the manufacturers or out of good will offer refund as this should not happen if you follow the instructions. This is a fault of the company and poor quality clothing.\nFrom the many bad reviews I‚Äôve seen over various sites and forums, I can see this is a reoccurring problem with scamming decent people. I will be taking this further.\nThe Customer service team need better training on how to handle these situations.",

I now own 3 items, a corset size small, a skirt size small and a knitted dress size medium.\n\nThe corset and skirt is the matching denim coord... well it may as well be made for someone who is a size 4. These items are not true to size.\n\nThe brown knitted dress, I chose to get this in a Medium as clearly the sizes come up a lot smaller. this was also extremely tight and I'd say was to fit more of a size 6. it could also do with a couple of inches added to the bottom.\n\nUsually things like this wouldn't bother me, but, the sizing of this clothing has knocked my confidence massively and I'm sure others would've had the same problem.\n\nI'd say if you tend to be a size 8 or above then go 2 sizes up. I'd say this is a brand for more petite girlys.",

Only after chasing them for my original delivery, they said the items were out of stock at time of purchase therefore they went into back order to be shipped 2 weeks later - please note there was NO mention of this at all at time of purchase nor on the order confirmation! When asking to cancel the back order they REFUSED to do so. I should have known then that I was in for a scam! Because WHY are you confirming my order if the stock is not there? Anyway, it should be easy enough to cancel a back order, since the item was unavailable therefore not allocated yet. But they said NO.\nWhen I finally got my order (for a total of 4 items), I opened 2 (I repeat, TWO) of the packages to have an idea of the sizing and quality of the fabric. The 2 items were NOT tried on and put back into original poly bags straight away, since no longer needed (arrived late for my event, as per above!). All 4 items, 2 of which weren‚Äôt even opened AT ALL, were sent back as an approved return. I then get an email saying my return was received, but cannot be accepted and I won‚Äôt get my refund, due to ALL garments having a strong SCENT upon inspection. This is clearly an excuse, since only 2 out of 4 items were ever out of the package, in a CLEAN home, for no longer than 1 minute! When I replied saying I was offended by their statement, extremely disappointed in their service AND asked to escalate and to clarify what type of scent they were referring to, I was told by one customer service manager that they are ‚Äúnot specific when describing scents‚Äù (???) and that no, they won‚Äôt accept my return, as due to this scent none of the garments is in re sellable condition, despite UNWORN, with all tags and ribbons.\nI find this outrageous.\nPlease unless you are 100% sure you‚Äôll keep your order in its entirety, do not risk your money here!",

I of course challenged this and had a reply that said multiple people also said there was a strong scent and having admitted my dog had got hold of the tag I was met with the assumption that my dog must have been laying on it so they can‚Äôt accept it back for hygiene reasons- you absolutely couldn‚Äôt make this up now I‚Äôm being accused of something that didn‚Äôt happen. Surely a tag can be changed. The item is in perfect condition, absolutely no scent and the security ribbon still in tact as it was clearly unworn. Their customer\nservice team needs some training and I will be taking this further. I am so angry that they have made up things to not return. Had they have said it was because of the tag I could have maybe accepted but to make up that it has a strong scent and to assume I have let me dog lay on it? Needless to say I won‚Äôt be using them again and I will be sharing on social media and taking a trip to their HQ so they can all smell it in front of me and tell me what the strong scent supposedly is",

I‚Äôm a size 12 for reference. The quality wasn‚Äôt the best. The lace was of poor quality, was on par with SHEIN.\n\nThe bodysuit was alone was ¬£43! I‚Äôm not the sort of person to spend this sort of money on an item such as a bodysuit but was hoping to wear it to my works Christmas party.\n\nThe bodysuit had a hygiene sticker on it. There was no way you could try it on without removing the hygiene sticker.\n\nFast forward to today, I have receive an email to say they won‚Äôt be refunding me due to removing the hygiene sticker, pet hairs on the items and a scent to it.\n\nI‚Äôm beyond shocked! I literally had the item on for about 2 minutes maximum. More shocked they‚Äôre saying there is a scent to the item and pet hair. The items were returned in perfect condition with all the tags they came with.\n\nThis was my first order with Wanderdoll and it will be my last.\n\nIf I do not receive a refund, I will speak to trading standards regarding this.\n\nIn reply to their response. The website doesn‚Äôt state ANYTHING AT ALL about no refunds on bodysuits without hygiene stickers. And the pet hair and scent you‚Äôre talking about is non existent!!!! I received the items back yesterday and they‚Äôre in perfect condition!!! I‚Äôve literally got the item in front of my eyes and there is nothing wrong with it! It‚Äôs like your making me out to be a lying! I think your returns team are blind. Funny thing is, you accepted the skirt back and out of the two products, if there were pet hair on anything, it would be on skirt where it‚Äôs touched the floor when trying on.

So if there are any problems with the item you receive, customer service will show very little interest and avoid to refund as much as they can. As they are small retailer and goods made from cheap materials, don't expect much. I will avoid this company and that is my advice for all the girls. There are plenty better quality retailers in this country.\nUpdate. I was not refunded nor I got the item they had to send me. The customer service is totally useless and clueless or just playing games. I personally think it's unethical business.

How are we meant to know how long a courier will take to deliver an item to them, guess?\n\nRude staff, no customer service skills, and honestly will never ever shop with them again",

Ofcourse it had been worn that is why I purchased it.\n\nI had to result to take this to the Consumer Ombudsman, Trading Standards and contact my bank to try and get this resolved. After proceeding with my actions they have finally given me a refund today, however my emails have again been ignored and I‚Äôve had no apology from them which goes to show how much they don‚Äôt care about their customers but more about the money.\n\nJust be aware for future reference, they are quick to take your money but when it comes to a faulty item that‚Äôs within 30 days you will struggle to get a refund. Just bare in mind, after The Consumer Law Act 2015 you are fully entitled to a full refund of the garment if it becomes faulty within 30 days and should it become faulty within 6 months you will be entitled by law for the company to exchange or for a credit note.\n\nJust so everyone is clear on their rights for this specific company, as they try not to abide by The Consumer Act law.\n\nThankyou for your time to read this and I will never be purchasing anything from yourselves ever again, and I will be spreading the word.",

I returned several items as I thought the quality was pretty poor given the price they're charging (the quality really is no better than what you'd get on Boohoo). These were returned in perfect condition.\n\nA couple of weeks later, one of the items was sent back to me. I thought this must have been an error as I had received no notification from the company to say they were returning an item. When I contacted Wander Doll, they told me that their returns team had found makeup on the garment and therefore could not accept the return. I explained that this was impossible as I was not wearing makeup when I tried on the clothing.\n\nWhat followed was me asking several times for details of where this makeup was found and photographic evidence taken by their returns team to prove this. I eventually was told that \"makeup was visible on the back of the garment, the front of the garment and the bottom of the blazer at the back\" and \"around the bottom of the garment.\" In response to this, I provided a video, which showed the entire garment was in perfect condition, with no makeup marks whatsoever. Upon receiving this video, the Wander Doll team suddenly changed their tune and said they would provide a refund if I returned the item.\n\nI asked once again for the evidence from their returns team that showed the item was supposedly covered in makeup. I was told that \"an error has been made by our returns team who did not take photographic evidence which is our policy to do so\". Convenient.\n\nI have read several other reviews on Trustpilot and Google identifying pretty much the exact same scenario - either people being told their item had makeup marks or a 'scent' and therefore could not be returned, so seems this is a scam they try on a regular basis.\n\nUnless you want to lose money and spend several weeks arguing with an incompetent and frankly quite rude customer service team, I'd suggest avoiding this company at all costs.",

To be told they was marks on the inside lining of set top which was a corset !\nThey sent photos and the photos you can barely see any marks to the point i questioned how do I know they wasn‚Äôt already on the top as who checks in that much detail the inside lining of a top ! They still refused to refund me even though that mark could of been on this prior to be receiving customer service very dismissive couldn‚Äôt answer my questions why it took so long to let me know and why I had to chase even for a part refund ! They like to with hold your money and will clearly do anything to get out refunding people on top of that the refund now takes an extra 10 days for just the trousers ! All tags and ribbon was attached and they could tell I hadn‚Äôt worn the item !\nHow do I know someone hasn‚Äôt made these marks in their warehouse with it being back there 2 weeks !!!! Before emailing me to say they had received it will be seeking legal advice on this as I think this is disgusting behaviour and very unfair when I clearly haven‚Äôt worn the item and I had no tan or make up on as had actually been for my first wedding dress fitting the day I tried it on top of the fact I kept the sizes which fit me and I wore !\nWould not buy from them again and iv warned all my friends about how bad this experience was even they couldn‚Äôt see the marks they was trying to show on the photos they sent !",

The customer service team are 10/10.\nA button fell off my pyjamas on the first ever collection and they sent me out a replacement for free!

I didn‚Äôt even do up the zip when I tried it on. I sent both items back for a refund. I had an email from the items saying company saying my return was received on the 29/4, and only today they emailed me saying they have only refunded me for one item, saying I removed a label on the other one and are sending it back to me. They attached a photo; which didn‚Äôt show any label removed, and I know there wasn‚Äôt one removed when I I sent it, because I tried it on for less than 10 seconds. Disgusting customer service, as I returned both items in the mail exact condition they arrived in. You can‚Äôt buy from this company as you cannot guarantee you will get a refund for any returns, even if they weren‚Äôt even tried on and in perfect condition. Items are over priced and the item I ordered looked ridiculous in person and can‚Äôt imagine anyone wearing it and looking nice",

The brand has grown in strengths ever since and I‚Äôm constantly buying from them whether it‚Äôs loungewear, bikinis, dresses and tops! I‚Äôm always getting complimented in the outfits and the quality is always insane. In the last year or so my cousin Nicole has also joined the team and her designs are just beautiful and I‚Äôm very proud. 10/10 clothes, delivery and customer service. Just received Riri Jumpsuit and it fits like a glove! Highly recommend this brand üíó",

It super supportive aswell . I have had 2 kids and never thought I'd feel so confident in a bikini again am actually in love . I really hope they get more colours in as I NEED them all .\nThe frills are super flattering and cute cant say enough about it.\nI also love that the top and bottom are sold separate as I need 8 for top and 10 of bottom .

Definitely worth ordering from üíó",

I love this brand and I am very loyal customer and this is your go- to for that special outfit! I would not hesitate to recommend their clothes to anyone (and their Instagram is super duper pretty) 10 out 10 for this company - and their customer service is impeccable! xxx",
